I think to be on this list Mathematicians should have some theorem, proof or claim to fame. Just as I would not add my mother-in-law to a list of artists, though she does a fair watercolour, it is not just enough to do maths. Of course, if someone knows that he has some claim to fame in the mathematics world then add him again, perhaps with a page to describe his work.

The bot also downloads actual articles, and gets from there birth/death/country information (from the categories at the bottom of articles).   <LF>   The bot gives more priority to what is in those article pages than to what is in this list, so stuff in this list may be overwritten.

That is, if you want to change a mathematicians's name, or country, or dates of birth/death, you must change ''in the mathematician's article'', and the change will propagate here.

The question is written in such a way as to presuppose the answer Sammy wants, and is therefore too non-neutral to produce valid results. In particular, neither having a mathematics Ph.D., nor being a mathematics professor, not publishing mathematics research, are sufficient to be listed in any of these lists, if one is not ''notable'' for those activities. So I believe the correct phrasing is that one should be listed in any of these lists if one has done something notable in mathematics. Note that mathematics is a strict subset of the union of (mathematics research, conducting tertiary education in mathematics) and includes also mathematical pedagogy research, mathematics popularization, philosophy of mathematics, history of mathematics, mathematical art, mathematical textbook writing, etc. If a subject is notable for any of those things, they should be listed as a mathematician. By Sammy's elitist standards even Euclid would not count as a mathematician, since it is primarily as a textbook writer that he is known. See also a long previous discussion at [[Talk:Vi Hart]] (who has indeed conducted original mathematics research, but is notable not for that but for her mathematics popularization) which came to roughly the same conclusions. â

It was developed in North America. I need some advise on whether there are any risks If I decide to start taking it(apparently  , tests revealed that there are no side affects).  It is in capsule form to be taken each night, and is 400mg of pure collagen per capsule. The trade name is Pure-Col. The information is that it is 'a molecular hydrolyzed collagen, generated by a unique process for better absobency using aminolock sequence technology'. This means nothing to me -though the product complies to the food safety act (and regulations). Would appreciate any advise. &lt;small&gt;â€”

It is certainly far less misleading than the widespread practice of referring to the Republic (as opposed to the Island as a whole) as &quot;Ireland&quot; (as enshrined in Article 4 of The Republic's 1938 constitution) or the even more confusing term ''Irish Republic'' unwittingly used by many Unionists (and others) to describe &quot;the south&quot;  when it actually refers to the notional ''All-Ireland'' republic to which nationalists aspire.

The Irish folk hero Setanta has been hijacked by both Republicans and Loyalists and politicised. That does not mean that the myth never existed until these two polar opposite groups decided the character represented their respective 'cause'.   <LF>   ::: Some of the more stringent unionists, and probably many Loyalists too, use the idea of the Cruthin to demonstrate how the history of our peoples isn't as straightforward as 'native' and 'Planter'. Some go further than that.   <LF>   ::: The problem though, is that we're dealing with a pre-history society in the case of the Cruthin - very little is actually known about them. One theory is that they had lived as a matriarchial(sp?) society, as opposed to the Celtic culture's patriarcial society. Another is that they spoke with a pre-Celtic tongue. Another is that they arrived at the same time as Celts, or were themselves Celts.   <LF>   ::: We should probably note all of these theories, but I don't believe it is necessary to politicise it in terms of Catholics versus Protestants or nationalists vs unionists. Too many things are polarised in that way already, which only serves to further divide the people, rather than give us all some kind of common ground and mutual appreciation and understanding. It is wrong to dismiss something simply on the grounds that it is perceived to be, in mordern terms, of nationalist or of unionist import. Instead, we should just present the theories and/or facts, and let the reader formulate their own opinion, or do further research for themselves.

However the source is a Northern Ireland Life &amp; Times survey, which sampling was specifically of Northern Irish people. This is an article on Unionism in Ireland as in the whole island not a select part of it. Thus I think the source may only be referring to the actual sentence it is appended to, i.e. ''&quot;However, these are generalisations, because there are both [[Protestant nationalist]]s and [[Catholic unionist]]s,&quot;'', which the source backs up and there is no issue with.   <LF>   :The sentence that you are altering which before your edit is ''&quot;Most, but not all, unionists are of one of various [[Protestant]] backgrounds.

But the claim that Oklahoma has more shoreline than any other state is as artificial. After all, both [[Michigan]] and [[Minnesota]] &quot;10,000 lakes&quot; have more internal shoreline... and Michigan has the huge shorelines of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie.    <LF>   Are Oklahoma's shorelines, artificial as they are, well managed for recreational purposes?

The category &quot;healthy lives&quot;, for example, is apparently judged to be deaths before age 75. How is that a valid way to judge the health of people's lives? And the criteria for each of the five categories is similarily vague, off-point... rediculously off point. For example, how is the quality of medical care determined by how often people recieve care? Obviously, the survey is not valid scientific material, and the corresponding USA Today article has this to say:   <LF>   &quot;Efforts to measure and compare quality can be controversial. Medical providers question whether the data were adjusted properly to account for variations in age or sickness or whether the items measured are an accurate reflection of performance. The Commonwealth Fund report will likely garner the same kind of concern.&quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2007-06-13-health-states-usat_N.htm]   <LF>   It then goes on to explain that while the survey is probably not accurate, it may have some merit since there is some ''limited'' research that, for example, the number of insured people ''may'' correspond to access to healthcare. Okay... but not worthy of being encyclopedic for sure. This is one of thousands of health surveys that each has different rank for each state, so editors in the past have purposely avoided these. Which is why this article generally has included only government-sanctioned surveys for education and healthcare state rankings, etc. We should certainly not keep this lone health survey in the article as if to imply that it is the most reliable, factual, or worthy to be included in an encyclopedia - a Featured article, nonetheless. There's my take on it. Please feel free to not agree with me, I have an open mind. '''[[User:Okiefromokla|Okiefromokla]]'''â

I'm not going to make a big issue about its inclusion or exclusion in the article, but the Commonwealth Fund that conducted the survey is a pretty respectable, well-known group:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund  It's current president is a native of Oklahoma with a Ph.D. in economics from Rice University, so I don't think it can be said that the non-profit charitable organization is trying to be purposefully unflattering to the state.  And in my opinion the general criticisms you raise about the statistical validity of the survey could be used to argue against any survey, i.e., what does the data really indicate?  Personally, I think surveys and statistical data from non-profit charitable foundations are at least as credible - if not more so - than any government-compiled statistics, as those numbers get fudged fairly systematically by bureaucrats with various funding-related agendas.   <LF>   As a ''general'' observation on the current Oklahoma article, it reads like it was written and edited by the state [[Chamber of Commerce]] Association with an exclusive eye toward trying to attract businesses, new residents, tourists or whatever to the state.

It is almost relentlessly upbeat in its portrayal of the state in all of the article sections that allow a degree of editorial viewpoint to be expressed in them, however subtly, either by inclusion or omission of material.

If you don't like this study, find one that you think is valid, and replace the questionable one with a better one.  Deleting it without offering an alternative just discourages productive contributions.

Look through them all if you wish, but I assure you they are valid. Yes, there are positive facts, but also negative facts. And both positive facts and negative facts are well documented and warrented. For example, the second thing mentioned in the education section is that Oklahoma is ranked near the bottom of states in expenditures per student, and goes on to say that the state is near last in high school graduation, etc. The health section, for another example, makes clear Oklahoma is in the top states for obesity, ranks near last in doctors and nurses per-capita, and is one of two states without physical education requirements in schools. The state is among the worst for usage of renewable energy, lost 90,000 jobs in the energy sector between 1980 and 2000, the state has the worst bridges in the nation (I actually added just now when I was thinking about negative things about the state).

You mention editors were probably turned off by my attitudes - I'm not going to address this. I rewrote the article in about a week so it could be promoted to FA status and be ready for the main page in time for its centennial, and nothing more. Why would I actively seek help in making this article if I intended to revert half of the edits? I would appreciate if in the future you did not accuse me of such rediculous things without proof. Now that we have that out of the way, I think I made a good case for removing the health survey, and I didn't simply remove it without a good reason. I was fairly sure there wouldn't be any objections once other editors read the description of what the survey was - it's just so obvious that it is a flawed study. In fact, I was going to ask if there was consensus to remove it, but then I read the USA Today article about the survey, and it confirmed by doubts, stating outright that the survey's validity was controversial and questioned by medical professionals. So, in short, I felt removing it and then giving my reasoning was the most prudent course of action.   <LF>   ::::As for your concern that I should have just found another survey: the reason I did not is because of the USA today article, which questions the validity of such health surveys.

I believe there was one that ranked Oklahoma as high as the low 30s, and others around 45 - which one to choose? What's for sure is the survey that I removed today was obviously flawed and not appropriate for the article - in my opinion. As I said before, I have an open mind, so feel free to disagree with me (not that its totally up to me, but if you wanted to convince me I'm open to it).   <LF>   ::::As for the Generosity Index, I question the logic of the Boston Globe's article.

These factors would include numbers insured, equity across the population groups, and the quality of care, for example.  (Here's an HHS site that shows that OK ranks 5th in percentage of people 18-64 who are uninsured at 24.8%.[http://209.217.72.34/hdaa/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePathName=P/Health%20Care%20Access%20and%20Use])  Perhaps something like that could be put in in lieu of the survey whose methodology you have an issue with.

In my opinion, the phrase in question would be good in the culture section, though &quot;southern religiosity&quot; is vague and awkward wording. Its just that defining the Bible Belt as conservative due to western individualism and southern religious tendencies is not addressed in the body per [[WP:Lead]], so in the lead is the first and last time we hear of it. But I also feel that it is probably not necessary to define the Bible Belt's cultural background in this article. It should be sufficient to say that Oklahoma is part of the conservative Bible belt, and readers can click on the wikilink to learn what makes the Bible Belt conservative. But regardless of my opinion on that subject, the lead should be as concise as possible, and by simply saying &quot;the Bible belt,&quot; Oklahoma becomes fully established as conservative and no more detail is necessary to convey that. The lead should be as less detailed as possible, and the more detail explaining what was in the lead should be in the body. '''[[User:Okiefromokla|Okiefromokla]]'''â

The united health foundation website only claims &quot;Public Health Spending&quot; and that can be specified within the article. I think we should stick with this source rather than second guessing every other source. Public health spending should be sufficient. Frankly, I do not buy the $1000 per person figure (and especially not in light of the millbank source, which seems to include higher ed, corrections, and other things that aren't directly related to health spending). This:[http://downloads.heartland.org/16974.pdf] says that oklahoma's ''total'' budget expenditure is about $6 billion. It is asbolutely absurd to claim that Oklahoma spends $1000 per person on health care (as you point out, this is somewhere around $3,439,000,000). That's over half of the state budget, and from my knowledge education usually the largest expenditure for states, not to mention room for everything else, like transportation. And it should be pointed out that statemaster.com claims its source is statehealthfacts.org, which then claims its source is millbank. So obviously both of those other sources are going to have bolstered figures since millbank does. '''[[User:Okiefromokla|Okiefromokla]]'''â

I agree with you now that its probably way more likely they are meaning to say healthcare within higher ed than overall higher ed. But I am confused why the state rankings would be so different if the only difference is medicaid. Does this mean Oklahoma's health spending is ranked 29, but it has such low medicaid funding compared to other states that it drops all the way to 40 when factoring this in? I hate dealing with these kinds of things because its so hard to find sources that agree with one another or one that is more valid than the rest.

I have not been able to locate that, but if it were available that would be a good reference. The percentage I got of 50% to 52% was county that Tulsa and OKC are in plus and appropriate adjacent county populations around OKC and Tulsa, that in some cases I was sure included rural small communities that would never be considered part of a &quot;[[Metropolitan area]]&quot;. Just looking at the [[Metropolitan area]] article, they mention that sources can vary by millions and people tend to use the higher numbers for there city. So not sure why we would want to use a totally non-sourced number in the article. Second, I am wondering why you would change the article to use 60% in lieu of the correctly rounded up 59%. Why not be accurate and factual. I am new to Wikipedia editing, but I would think it would be very important to have factual numbers and not ones that are inflated. I would be inclined to remove the percentage factoid in the article if the percentage is not changed to be accurate and proper references are used that define the Metro region in an acceptable non-inflated manner. And to answer where the 65% came from, it looks like was from two of your edits at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=149656244 and http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=149801219  I will leave it as is for now, but if valid arguments cannot be provided in the next few days to keep this in, I will remove it from the article this weekend.

In Wikipedia, it is not appropriate to use Wikipedia articles as sources, and, in this case, it is still not appropriate to use an unsourced statement in the [[Combined Statistical Area]] article to support your argument. The statement in question that you keep refering to is not a rule by any stretch of the imagination and seems to be opinion in it of itself - a combined statistical area is '''always''' a census designated region and it is ''always appropriate''. The article says &quot;nearly 60%&quot; live in the OKC and Tulsa metro areas, which is appropriate for both the 59% figure of the CSAs and the 58% figure without the CSAs. Like I keep saying, if you wish to change the &quot;nearly 60%&quot; to &quot;59%&quot; or &quot;58%&quot; - that would be completely reasonable. The 58% would be accounting for only the MSA and not the additional county added for the CSA. But simply disagreeing with the United States Census Bureau on its definition of a metro area is not a reason to delete a completely true statement. If there is anything at all I can do to help you to understand what a Metropolitan Area is, please tell me, as I am fairly well versed in the subject. You may be confused in that you are thinking a Metropolitan Area is the &quot;urbanized area&quot; surrounding a city or a contiguous area of urban development, but this is not the case. Once again, if you scroll up to the links I have provided during this conversation, you will see that the United States government defines a metropolitan area very specifically much like it defines what constitutes a city or other census-designated statistical areas, and it very much includes rural areas surrounding a city. There is even a wikilink in the article to [[Metropolitan Area]], which explains what this is. Additionally, the Metropolitan Area population figures for '''every''' U.S. city in Wikipedia is '''always''' taken from the Census' tally. I find your argument illogical in that you simply claim that the Census bureau's figures for the Tulsa and OKC MSAs are inflated.

Those are explained and referenced in the individual city articles fairly well, but not in the Oklahoma article. You had the number at 65% to start, before you reduced to the rounded up ''nearly'' 60%. I do understand the US Census Bureau and it's definitions. They are clear. As I have told you, I have examined all the references and understand them. The problem I am having is the way the numbers are presented and explained in the article. If you feel the nearly 60% should be in the article, Then I believe it should be fully explained with what a CSA is and also explained that it is NOT the &quot;urbanized area&quot; of Tulsa and Oklahoma City. It is a very broad area that is defined by the US Census Bureau. Looking at the map of the CSA anyone would realize the population in that area is much more then Tulsa and Oklahoma City. That explanation should be fully provided in the &quot;Demographics&quot; section and not a quick hit in the lead. And the map of the CSA's should be provided right below the population Density map. I think that would make it clear to the reader that nearly 60% of the population in Oklahoma does NOT live in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. The link in the lead sentence links to [[Metropolitan area]] and that does not describe a CSA or its implications. The way the sentence is written and used makes it deceiving. That is the problem I have. If you want to add something that clearly explains the nearly 60% number and put in the Demographics section, I don't have a problem. But, I do have a problem with saying that 60% of the population lives in Tulsa and Oklahoma City in the lead. And, please don't come back with something condescending. Try to understand the problem I have with saying &quot;Nearly 60 percent of Oklahomans live in the [[metropolitan areas]] of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]&quot; with no further clarification.

It's odd to use a specific number like 58 percent as the rounding destination by saying a number is &quot;near&quot; it.

Note well that the Texas/Oklahoma state line is the longest in the United States, and that the Oklahoma Panhandle in the northwest -- a region that must be colder and drier than the rest of the state -- is also close to the &quot;Texas state line&quot;. Besides, the &quot;Texas state line&quot; is two perpendicular lines between western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; the rest is the Red River.    <LF>   In essence, Oklahoma gets warmer toward the south and wetter toward the east... I have adjusted such wording as &quot;along the Texas state line&quot; in reference to climate to &quot;the south&quot;, &quot;the southeast&quot;, or &quot;along the Red River&quot;.

There's not another good oil well picture, and the Cimarron County picture is just a bad, ugly picture that doesn't illustrate the content well. [[:Image:Dust Storm Texas 1935.jpg]] is the best dust bowl picture on Wikipedia, and scenes like that were common throughout the Oklahoma Panhandle and all the areas affected, so that's all that matters. In short, I chose the best example of the dustbowl rather than a bad picture that doesn't fit into the section well simply because it's in Oklahoma. Besides, [[Stratford, Texas]] is litterally a few miles from the OK border, so I think it's a perfectly good example of Oklahoma's dust bowl.

That is probably why the Association of Religion Archives classifies it as evangelical protestant. This is based on an impartial source, not the church itself.

Well, on the subject, I disagree with deletion of picture. I really want to show that 2mm pick is exactly 2mm thick and I show the right way to measure it: it's not about measuring the thickest part of the pick (it will include an outstanding logo shouldn't be counted in, as these letters are not solid enough to contribute to pick structural strength), it's not about measuring only the thickness of edge (where it would be less than 2mm, because thick picks are sharpened at edges). Also, this picture illustrates what precision is used by pick manufacturers to measure their products: it's about +-0.05mm.   <LF>   :In fact, for example, I'm still curious about the same issue on string gauge. Currently, I have no idea how to measure strings to get whatever numbers manufacturers use, when things come to wound strings. Roundwound strings give more than written on them, flatwound give less. I think that a picture with measurement of guitar string would be helpful too, but, alas, I don't know how to do it :(

Original research that is wrong.   <LF>   Thin picks produce a chimey, bright sound. A thin pick does not deflect the string much, so it is not able to stimulate the fundamental note as well as a thick pick. A thin pick has very fast release. This fast release stimulates the harmonics.    <LF>   Thicker picks stimulate the fundamental note more. The harmonic content depends on the shape and texture of the pick. Smooth, round thick picks produce a dark tone, because the string glides off the pick, rather than snapping off. However, sharp edges or matted texture add considerable brightness. The shape, machining and material has a huge impact on tone. Therefore, it is impossible to generalize about the tone of thick picks. Wipe out the bullshit and start agai

Nicotinic acid is not converted to nicotinamide before being converted to NAD. It's converted after. Nicontinic acid first forms NaMN -&gt; NaAD -&gt; NAD then is deconverted back to nicotinamide from NAD like everything else that forms NAD. But saying it's converted to nicotinamide in vivo makes it seem like nicotinic acid is just a bad precursor for nicotinamide, when in fact the only common pathway happens after the conversion to NAD, which isn't an important fact. http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/324/3/883/F3.large.jpg  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;

Basically, they're separate substances with separate sets of effects. If anything, it's the merge that will cause more of a confusion. As the article asserts, nicotinamide is not toxic in doses up to 3 grams per day. Nicotine is not &quot;toxic&quot; either if consumed in the right dose, typically just a few milligrams. As an alternative, I don't care if this article gets moved to Niacinamide instead.

However, the overwhelming majority of the article is about what the character does within its fictional universe. (Exceptions at the very end are about how people can spend money on it.) Meanwhile, [[WP:WIAGA#Articles dealing with fiction|WIAGA]] says: ''The focus of the article should remain on discussing the subject as fiction within the context of &quot;our&quot; universe, not on establishing it as a &quot;real&quot; topic in a fictional universe....'' To my mind, the focus is on the latter, and thus the article is not a good one according to WIAGA.

I went through the list at [[WP:WAF]] of what should be included to give an out-of-universe perspective.

Unless a PokÃ©Dex entry gives a comparison, there would be no way to make a connection from Eevee to the real world without using original research.  I can't see what an example article written in the 'out-of-universe' style like [[Lakitu]] has that Eevee doesn't.

Thus, it meets the [[WP:WIAGA|qualifications]] for a Good Article. As with the other Pokemon-articles, continue to strive for relevance outside the world of Pokemon (not easy, I know, but it's still important), completeness, and a limited use of jargon and technical language.   <LF>   Also, I'd like to ask that editors refrain from 'hammering' the GA nomination list by nominating the same article many times in a very short period, or from attempting to bypass the system by renominating articles without making changes in an attempt to get a 'lenient' reviewer. The technique is starting to attract some attention, and could damage the reputation of the Pokemon articles and project. Being satisfied with your work is more important than a category tag.

Anyway, that paragraph is necessary for the article.  Its goal is not to sell stuff; rather, it is to convey that Eevee has significance in this universe and is worthy of a GA.  One of the main criticisms (heck, just read the other topics further up on this page) is that more emphasis is placed on Eevee's role in the PokÃ©mon universe rather than our own.  The article has to show products featuring Eevee so that it has an in-universe perspective.

My largest issue, i suppose is that after mentioning an item, there's an external link going directly to that product (the pokeDoll is defunct however).  While many of the items are pokemon.com exclusive, it gives the sense of endorsement by the editors.  One ref link, perhaps merely to pokemon.com itself after a sentence describing how they have made several exclusive eevee products would improve it.  also, rather than having a full sentence saying: there's an eevee this.  there's an eevee that. it should prolly read as eevee has been made into this, that, and those.

While it has metafctional elements, it's not in itself a work of metafiction.  It doesn't have the self-consciousness present in most metafiction.  For instance, &lt;i&gt;Breakfast of Champions&lt;/i&gt; is, at its heart, a book about Vonnegut's writerly persona; Hamlet is not a play about Shakespeare (except in some convoluted modern reading.)  A lot of metafiction is &quot;writing a book about writing a book.&quot;  There's no way to summarize [[House of Leaves]], for instance, without mentioning that it is a book about someone writing a book about someone who wrote a book about someone who made a movie.  No one, however, would summarize Hamlet as &quot;a play about someone performing a play.&quot;  The metafictional elements are incidental to the plot.     <LF>   : Most of all, I'm going to pull it because of the intention of the list.

Not only the play-inside-the-play thing (which is enough by itself) but all the questions he rises about acting and theatre. Why should the actor cry about Hecuba, who is Hecuba for him (remember?). The monologue mourning the death of the actor, where he takes his skull, is maybe the second most known one after the &quot;to be or not to be&quot; one. Midsummer Night Dream is indeed metafictional, so are most Shakespear's plays, an so is all Barroque literature. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] argues that Don Quixote and Hamlet make as wonder if we, ourselves, are not fictional charachter being read or watched. Of course, Pirandello is more explicite, but Hamlet it's a must in such a list. See [[http://literature.wikia.com/wiki/Metafiction literawiki on metafiction]]

So, what's the diference? It's one of the crucial aspect of postmodernist fictional evolution, isn't it... Some low-costed theorists indiferently group them terming &quot;embedding&quot; or self-reference. Godel's already self-reference, no less than Hegel, everything interesting in any symbolism. There ''is'' certain diference. For example, as English fiction focuses on personae (Faulkner is extreme in this sense), French one picks up some concrete medial objects (journal, lettre, &amp;c.) when embedding. Shakespeare was no doubt one of the original models for French medial embedding scheme, though the intentionality is parallel to metafiction. That causes alternative reading effects.   <LF>   Third approach may be sought in minor fictions like of Philip K. Dick. (Not that academic ''VALIS''!  ''Ubik'', ''Flow my tears,...'' are neither personal nor medial, for exemple. They also are great metafictional art work.)   <LF>

This is slightly different from the most general case of meta-references, which are any references by the work or characters to the fact that they are characters in a book, movie, video game, etc.  The theme show music thing falls into that category, but does not directly acknowledge the existence of the audience, so it may not be breaking the fourth wall. However, it definitely strains or even breaks the suspension of disbelief.    <LF>   :Meta-fiction should strictly only be fiction inside a fictional work. Meta-fiction could perhaps include the Red Book of the LOTR series, because that multi-volume book is without a doubt a reference to the real world books themselves. Presumably the Red Book even references itself in the same places. So within the LOTR universe, it is a mere meta-reference in a historical book, but to us, it is the fictional book inside itself, so one could argue it is a meta-fictional device.   <LF>   :However from the article it is clear that while meta-fiction should be merely fiction inside fiction, the term has been abused to encompass anything and everything that might strain the suspension of disbelief.

Crystal radios use a variety of circuits and to present one circuit as defining could be misleading; the lead section should be more generic and inclusive of all that is crystal radio.  It is also somewhat wrong in presenting &quot;LC&quot; tuning as the simpliest because inductor-only tuning is simplier than the &quot;LC&quot; tuning.

The only way to retune is by changing a tap on the coil. The manual says that making more taps will make tuning &quot;sharper&quot;. That is not the right word since the resonance Q-factor can not be increased that way. 2) I believe the earpiece is a crystal type not an inductive type. A crystal earpiece resembles a capacitor, hence it does not pass current and discharges via the 47 kilohm resistor connected in parallel. (A personal reminiscence is that the first crystal set I tried to make was similar to this design. It made no sound at all. Later I found my error had been to wind my coil around a tin can

The coil tunes using a slider connection and resonates against the capacitance of the antenna. This design was used because Variable Caps were not available to the builders (eg soldiers in trenches).   <LF>   To put it another way, the capacitance of a long wire antena is quite large. This capacitance will swamp a normal tuned circuit and will prevent the tuning cap covering the band. At the very least the antenna needs to be tapped well down the coil or coupled in via a small value cap in series. The solution to all this was to delete the tuning cap, and instead adjust the number of turns in the coil (as shown correctly in the diagram).   <LF>   BTW, the small cap shown is to bypass the RF after the detector. It is not really necessary.    <LF>   The capacitor symbol is wrong (should have only two bars), but again, it attempts to show a &quot;homemade&quot; cap (perhaps made from layers of tinfoil from a bubblegum wrapper).   <LF>   The mention of &quot;ultra-thin litz wire inductors&quot; is clumsy.

We don't need to make up symbols; it demonstrates lack of knowledge and cannot be researched (except for the antenna symbol.)  We should not be introducing readers to incorrect symbols.  This should be changed to a wiring pictorial or a valid schematic.  Besides being out of place and unreferenced, there are technical problems with this diagram.   The antenna and detector should be connected to the same point on the coil, or in a more complex circuit the detector connection separately adjustable.  The capacitor is for VLF use only, and invites confusion with use as a tuning capacitor.  Does it have enough value to retain?  Can we fix and reference it or delete i

The answer lies in several established facts, combined with observations which many private experimenters have observed related to resonance as a way to amplify power. If you study particle physics you will learn how all observable energy is ultimately a result of the constantly appearing and disappearing particle flux, which because of its strange behavior have been called the 'virtual particle flux'. Energy is constantly being created and destroyed (at least as far as todays scientists can reach in terms of observation), and so explaining an extra influx of energy would be no more of a problem than saying that the symmetry for a given reaction was not completely perfect, and so more energy was gained by the constantly energetic particle flux than what was used to excite it. This is also where the term COP (coefficient of performance) is better to use than efficiency, since it describes the reaction better than an efficiency calculation.

This is not very mysterious because the coil sections are coupled together inductively, since they are wound on the same former, creating a transformer. Stray capacitance provides a route for the antenna signal to earth. Partly isolating the resonant circuit this way helps achieve a high [[Q factor]] which explains the &quot;mystery&quot; of these radios' good performances. The established understanding of the resonance here is that it does not &quot;amplify&quot; power, instead it provides an optimum power transfer from the antenna to the detector at the resonant frequency. Postulating that there is an unproven &quot;extra influx of energy&quot; that needs to be explained by ideas from particle physics is WP:OR. I do not regard any ''research'' as pseudoscience but invoking special explanations for common phenomena and disparaging anyone who is unconvinced as &quot;ignorant&quot; and/or a &quot;debunker that wants to prove [a] phenomenon wrong&quot; is characteristic language of [[pseudoscience]

Here the coil is doing double-duty as tuning component and audio transformer.  On the aerial side that increases the impedance of the load.

The power is enough to drive phones; it takes only a few nanowatts to produce audible sound in efficient phones.  In theory and in practice, this is easily produced in an antenna by MW and HF radio waves from stations thousands of miles away, no need for quantum mechanics here.  It does not need to power a larger load than the radio waves can manage.  (I have personally made the calculations and I have made the measurements to prove it.  It is a problem above VHF, but then, xtal sets do not work well there.)  Inverted L antennas with length around an eighth to quarter wavelength do not have incredibly high impedances, they are quite easy to match, thats why it works so well.     <LF>   :::::A good discussion is involved for this page, but briefly:  In weak signal mode, the phones are not actually the load on the tank, the diode is.

The antenna coupling circuitry, including the RF transformer actually matches the real part of the antenna radiation resistance, ground resistance and loss resistance to the diod

So the text mentioned that some circuits use the capacitance of the antenna alone, but most of the circuits I chose used tuning capacitors.  And you're certainly mistaken if you think that practical BCB crystal sets didn't use tuning capacitors.  There are literally hundreds of circuits of crystal sets that were tuned capacitively.  See [http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/ here] I didn't have time to check how they solved the tuning range problem, but it looks like many use tapped coils and cover the band in separate sections.  I think it's important to have a historical POV and show a variety of the circuits that were actually used.   Your point about tuning range is important, and deserves a section, but I think removing all circuits with tuning capacitors is going too far.

Discuss the matter here with regard to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, ''then'' change the article in accordance with compromise and consensus. Discuss the reliability of the sources and the representation of the cited sources in the article text and diagrams, ''not'' each other's intelligence, abilities or personal views. Having said that, here is my input: First, the scan of the 1950s article by L.B. Robbins looks authentic to me. Does anyone have any evidence that it is a modern con with technical errors introduced by someone else? If not then it seems to be a [[WP:RS]] reliable source and may be used to support the article. Second, I have made that circuit and so I know it works. This is [[WP:OR]] and so cannot be used in the article, but should be enough to stop the bickering. (I was trying to re-create a crystal radio made by my grandfather during WW2 and so wound a coil like his on a wooden former, but used a [[schottky diode]] as a detector and an audio amplifier instead of Hi-Z headphones. My grandfather's design was capacitor-less with a sliding earth-tap on the coil, connected by sandpapering away some insulation lacquer after winding it. Adding a small trimmer capacitor increased the selectivity and 'peaked' the reception slightly, but still only the most local medium-wave station was really receivable). So, the circuit is authentic, and it works. What's the problem with mentioning it in this article?

A completely different inductance is needed with the capacitor compared to without it, for the same long wire antenna and same reception band. I can dig out my old experiments and count the turns if anyone's interested, but it's largely irrelevant as it's [[WP:OR]], however it shows the principle is sound.

The argument is not over whether the circuit works; I think [[User:JA.Davidson|John]] would agree it does.  The problem is that the circuit is impractical for an actual radio because it can't tune the entire broadcast band.  John thinks that for this reason it shouldn't be included in the article, I think it should.  John, I understand the issue.   The AM broadcast band requires a tuning range of 3.09:1. So the tuning capacitance requires a range of the square of this: 9.5:1.  Since the minimum capacitance is the antenna capacitance, the tuning capacitor must be at least 9.5 times the antenna capacitance.  For a 15 meter antenna, which has a capacitance of about 135pF that's about 1300pF.  It's difficult to find air variables that large, so with a standard capacitor the radio won't tune the whole band.  So what?   These are technical details.  The circuit does in fact work.  Many people build crystal radios just for the educational value and don't care whether it covers the entire band. :More importantly, the purpose of the schematic John deleted is not to present a practical radio, but to illustrate for novices the operation of a crystal radio with the simplest, most easy-to-understand circuit.  Since the tuning capacitor is mentioned in the text, it has to include a tuning capacitor.  The circuit I used is the one most commonly employed in the literature to introduce crystal radios, and is ''very'' widely seen: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AJBBf5hCYqIC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 1], [http://books.google.com/books?id=t-N1KdTb0FwC&amp;pg=PT107#v=onepage&amp;q=crystal%20radio&amp;f=false 2], [http://www.skywaves.ar88.net/xtalset102/xtalset102.htm 3], [http://www.oldradioworld.de/gollum/dhistor.htm 4], [http://bellsouthpwp2.net/w/u/wuggy/rs99fun.htm 5], [http://books.google.com/books?id=uoj3IWFxbVYC&amp;pg=PA299#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6].  It says in [[WP:DUE]] that &quot;due weight&quot; must be given to different aspects of a subject &quot;in proportion to their representation in reliable sources&quot;.  Considering the wide appearance of this circuit in crystal radio literature, I think it probably should be included.   <LF>   :I have no objection to mentioning the drawbacks of this circuit in the article, in fact I insist on it.  But I don't think there is a better circuit for illustrating how crystal radios work.   John, I have given 6 references above, plus the 2 in the article, on the wide use of this circuit.   Where are your references backing up your claims that it is unusable?

The poor overall Q-factor due to the inefficiency of a (short) long wire antenna, the almost complete lack of impedance matching at every point (antenna -&gt; tuned circuit; tuned circuit -&gt; headphones), and probably a poor earth, means that the selectivity of the receiver is woeful. If you have a relatively local AM station, that is all you will copy, with all the others appearing as noise, wherever you tune in the band. All you really change is the s/n of the local station compared to all the others heard together. I found better selectivity in some of the low shortwave bands (4 MHz, 7 MHz?) using a smaller inductor, if I remember correctly. I found a variable inductor (sliding tap) essential in the absence of being given a precise 'recipe' including number of turns, length of antenna, short connection to ground spike or buried pipes, etc.

This article is not just about &quot;simple&quot; crystal radios, but many &quot;simple&quot; circuits do use a capacitor, and solve the tuning range problem easily by taps on the coil or a loading capacitor in the antenna circuit.

I did not intend to remove 'all mention' of C, if I did (?) I got confused.  However, there are still substantial issues with this discussion of resonance, and how the antenna's L and C get tuned with reactances in crystal sets.  There is still wrong stuff being stated as fact; this topic is not trivial and kinda beyond the scope of most readers of this article.  I wish y'all would fix it or leave it to the antenna folks in the antenna article.  I would suggest consider omitting stuff rather than misleading people.

If someone else wants to take it on, that'd be nice; my hope was to leave it alone in this article but it keeps coming up.  This is involved because an antenna acts like both coils and capacitors and they depend on the frequency.  An electrically short antenna has too much C and needs L in the radio to tune the whole system of radio &amp; antenna.  It also affects Z matching since X is part of Z = X + R.  The previous version of Fig 1 would have had to add too much L to tune with C, and the C would have needed way more range than any physically realizable variable cap could muster.  There are references for this issue in some of the old 1920s textbooks but thats another research projec

But I didn't want to go into the Shockley equation and the resulting reciprocal relation between a diode's forward current and its small-signal AC resistance.  The idea of a &quot;threshold&quot; for conduction is an approximation commonly used for diode's IV curves.  It's an easy way for novices to visualize the detector's sensitivity problem, and especially why a bias voltage can improve sensitivity, by getting rid of the threshold.   Crystal radio detectors' lack of sensitivity is often explained that way, as shown in the references.  If you can come up with a better way, I'm all ears.

But more importantly, there is no sharp diode threshold, but further, there is no diode threshold at all, this notion is not even approximately right.  This comes as a shock to most engineers, but the diode curve has no knee (NONE) at all, it is a complete optical illusion.  Mathematically the diode equation (and real diodes conduction) is an [[e (mathematical constant)|e-to-the-x form curve]] (with slight variation, corrupted slighted by &quot;n&quot; the so-called efficiency parameter), and that has no point of max curvature (knee), it just does not exist.  Don't take my word for it, check the second derivative of a real 1N34 plot, or plot this and look at it on different scales, the &quot;knee&quot; changes.  I realize the notion of a knee is very popular (to the point it is emotional to many), but utterly fictitious.  It misleads people to think germanium diodes will always detect better than silicon.  Not true, it completely depends on the impedance of the radio tuner and transformed antenna.  A lot of crystal set design is substantially suboptimal because of this misunderstanding; being popular doesn't make it technically right.  It doesn't even make sense, though college professors actually teach this nonsense in top universities.  Reality is that, for signals weak enough for the curve to be approximated by a linear segment, the inverse slope of the IV curve at the operating point (AKA detection Z) needs to match the Z of the radio, again not a trivial issue.  It is a tough point to communicate, and few will believe it, I would suggest just deleting the wrong stuff in the article and reference some Agilent papers or somethin

The current from a power plant arrives at your home, it passes through various devices in your home and then travels to the ground wire in the circuit box and from there to a ground wire buried in the earth under your home. In a sense the earth itself is the conductor that returns the current to the power plant where there is a massive grid of conductors buried in the ground. The earth is not a great conductor but there is a lot of it and so it works. There is no wire that returns the current to the power plant. The earth could be replaced with a gigantic capacitor but that would be prohibitively expensive. Similarly, a radio needs either a ground connection or to be connected to a large capacitance that acts like the earth. The use of early crystal radio sets in aircraft and such was problematic due to the vibrations to which the radio was subject not due to grounding problems. I am not certain about the grounding of aircraft but will speculate that the tremendous amount of air through which a moving craft is passing will act like a sufficient ground/capacitanc

How much capacitance is there between a satellite in synchronous orbit and the Earth?  A Mars rover and the Earth?  (For that matter, light is just really really high frequency radio waves and propagates just fine over intergalactic distances.) The Tesla model is inappropriate - radio receivers work with the free space field and any use of earth is for convenience.  At the frequencies used for AM broadcast, it's inconvenient to build an antenna that collects enough power to operate an earpiece, so you use the earth as part of the system  - but it's not really correct to think of Tesla-style currents running through the Earth from transmitter to receiver.

A crystal radio does not have to have a ground, it could use a dipole antenna; it's just that with the long wire antennas needed, a dipole would require a second long wire, doubling the length of the antenna, to give the same reception.   A monopole, due to the ground reflection, has 3 dB more gain than an equivalent dipole.    Another issue is that AM stations broadcast in vertical polarization, so a horizontal dipole isn't as efficient as a vertical monopole.  A crystal radio with a monopole antenna without a ground can also work,  because the radio's case and the hand holding it can function as the other half of a dipole antenna.  It will be much less sensitive but is probably adequate for the strong signals in an urban area.

If a counterpoise is too small or too far away from the Earth, its voltage will not remain constant and it will radiate (or in a receiver pick up radio waves), simply functioning as the other half of a dipole antenna.  That is actually how the [[whip antenna]]s in modern walkie-talkies, CB, and portable FM radios work. [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-whip-antenna.htm   8],  [http://books.google.com/books?id=fvtXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=counterpoise   9, p.53],   [http://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=counterpoise   10, p.48-49]  The whip is nominally a &quot;monopole&quot; antenna, but the other side of the transmitter or receiver is merely &quot;grounded&quot; to the radio's chassis or circuit board.

If they have enough capacitance to ground they function as a counterpoise.  If not, they function with the parasol as the two halves of a dipole antenna; the incoming radio wave induces opposite phase oscillating voltages in the antenna and the radio's case including the attached earphone wires, etc. which constitutes the input signal applied to the tuned circuit.

What it boils down to is: The oscillating current from the wire antenna, after passing through the radio, needs some conductor with a high capacity to flow into.  The Earth is ideal, but it doesn't have to be the Earth.

Whether the antenna is connected to the ground directly via a conductor into the ground or coupled to the ground by a counterpoise makes no difference, provided the capacitance is sufficiently large relative to the need. But of course, in writing the article, that idea needs to be expressed. Should the article describe the &quot;ground&quot; as a very large capacitance? If it is described as I did, as a large reservoir, that might work. The ground wire analogy with a physical connection back to the transmitter obviously fails in the case of spacecraft communication

The more power the antenna delivers, the better. A half-wave dipole is a good antenna, and it does not need a ground (but for practical reasons might need a balun). Over-the-air powered RFIDs can use dipole antennas. AM transistor radios also used ferrite loopsticks; they capture the magnetic field and do not need a ground. Consequently, a good ground is not a requirement. Back when crystal radios were popular, the operating frequency was low, the transmitted power levels were high (that pesky atmospheric noise required it), and people often used a crappy, untuned, single-ended, long-wire antenna. Grounding those antennas improved them. If the ground were perfect (which it isn't), it would make an image antenna and cause current to flow in the antenna wire. Simplistically, if there were no connection to ground (and no capacitance to ground), then no current (and no power) would flow from the single-ended antenn

Given the interest in crystal sets evident in this talk page, it is likely that what I have done will prove to be controversial, so I shall try to explain.  Firstly I have corrected the statement of the max power transfer theorem, so that it reads correctly.  Impedances should not be equal for max power transfer, but one should be the conjugate of the other. I do not expect any disagreement over this.     <LF>   However, it seems to me that the only respect in which this theorem can be applied to a crystal set is that the impedance of the power source (i.e. the aerial) should be matched to that of the the load (the earphones).  Ideally, the equivalent resistance of the tuned circuit at resonance should be severely mismatched to the source impedance of the aerial in order to minimise resistive losses in the tuned circuit, which can only be wasteful.  If  the tuned circuit were power matched to the aerial, maximum power would be transferred to the resistance of the tuned circuit, which is not what is required.   It is for this reason that I have deleted all references to the idea of matching the aerial to the tuned circuit.  Transforming the equivalent resistance of the aerial has significance in relation to selectivity, and this concept is best treated separately.  Both topics (impedance matching for max power transfer to the headphones, and aerial resistance transformation for improved selectivity) are complicated by the fact that so many different crystal set circuits are used.  In the circuit which accompanies the &quot;Impedance Matching&quot; section, it is clear that the left-hand slider can be used for tuning, and the right-hand one for impedance matching, and that the right-hand slider will also affect the Q of the inductor, and therefore the selectivity.  In more complicated circuits where a variable capacitor is used for tuning, and the aerial is connected to a variable tap on the inductor, the useful effect of the different tap positions will be to improve selectivity when the tap is low, since then the Q of the parallel tuned circuit will be at its greatest.  In this type of circuit, the resistance of the headphones will lower the Q of the parallel tuned circuit, so for greater selectivity, the resistance of the phones should be high.  In this circuit, power transfer to the phones will also be affected by the tap position, so that the tap control can be used either to improve selectivity, or to achieve best sensitivity, depending on requirements.  g4oep  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.96.60.31|77.96.60.31]] ([[User talk:77.96.60.31|talk]])

The aerial is connected to the crystal/earphone circuit ''through'' the tuned circuit.  Although there are many different circuits, the load resistance the aerial sees is some parallel combination of the resistance of the crystal/earphone circuit and the parasitic resistance of the tuned circuit (scaled by the impedance transformation of the antenna tap on the coil).   You can't separate those two resistances. To transfer max power to the earphone, the antenna must be matched to the impedance it sees, which is the parallel combination; that's what the [[maximum power transfer theorem]] says.   The max power theorem doesn't discriminate between resistances in the circuit; maximizing power to the earphone also maximizes power lost in the coil. 
889	888	163	162	4	232253	232253	886	-1	-1	-1	195	-1	Chetvorno	-1	Hi - I have looked at the paragraph you refer to, and although there is not much there to object to, I feel that the ideas involved in this section could be presented more rigorously.  The paragraph starts by stating that the aim is to transfer power to the headphones, then states &quot;Therefore, in better receiver circuits, to match the antenna impedance to the receiver's impedance...&quot;.  The point that I tried to express in the material you deleted is that the first objective is not necessarily achieved when the second is fulfilled.  True, it is necessary to match the receiver's aerial and earth terminals to the actual aerial/earth system in order to maximise power absorbed from the aerial, but then this absorbed power must be transferred to the phones with as little as possible lost in the tuned circuit.    <LF>   The resistive component of the input admittance of the receiver (considered as a parallel equivalent circuit) can be represented by 2 parallel components - 1) the transformed equivalent parallel resistance of the coil (or of the tuned circuit as a whole- Rc)) and 2) the transformed resistance of the phones/detector combination (Rp).  For maximum power in the phones, Rc should be large compared with Rp since in a parallel equivalent circuit, the same voltage is applied to both resistors, and P is inversely proportional to R (P = V^2/R).  This condition (Rc &gt;&gt; Rp) can be  represented by saying that the antenna should be matched to the phones, and mismatched to the resistance of the inductor.  That was what I wrote, and I feel that it should not have been deleted without proper justification. The resistances of the coil, and of the phones are indeed separable, and the design and adjustment of the circuit can be altered to control the fraction of the available power which is dissipated in each simply by adjusting their relative magnitudes.  These magnitudes are under the control of the various transformation ratios. This idea is completely false: &quot;maximizing power to the earphone also maximizes power lost in the coil&quot;.   I have altered the text again.  I expect that someone will quibble that the points I have made are not referenced, but it should be obvious to anyone who understands ac circuit theory that what I have written is correct; trust me - I am an engineer.  If you don't understand circuit theory, don't change it.  g4oep.   <LF>

I don't see anything in the three references above that actually says it has been successful in practice (although I haven't read every word in each of them - perhaps someone will quote the relevant bit(s)). First, the reception bandwidth of many practical crystal sets is very wide, due to lack of good filtering or tuning. This means there isn't much 'slope' anywhere to perform the FM to AM conversion. Secondly, the power capture of a traditional crystal set depends on a very long (e.g. hundreds of feet) random wire antenna. These are not much use at VHF, where most FM is transmitted, and would not capture more received power than a one or two meter tuned dipole. I don't know that such short reception antennae, even if tuned, would ever pick up enough power to hear directly unless one was very close to a transmitter. (VHF transmitters don't put out megawatts, as they know the range will be limited by line-of-sight anyway). I'd like to see a quote from an actual [[WP:RS]] before stating that crystal radios are practical on FM bands.

I'd instead expect that Wikipedia include this reference, even if there is a notation that to the effect that 'this may not be seen as apropriate by Native Americans'.  (Though a digression, my use of 'Native American' is another example of allowing people to choose the names they use for themselves.)   <LF>   Also, I believe that the concept of &quot;Two-Spirit&quot; is not as pervasive among Native Americans as is implied.  (I had never heard of this phrase or nor the particular concepts directly related to it until in an academic situation.)  I do not intend to say that the concept is inapplicable for all Native American traditions, however.  I will suggest that concepts of strict gender role have never had a real analogue among at least Creeks.   <LF>   I totally agree with the above and put it back again. especially because this article is also part of the LGBT. To make the distinction between 'Native' and  'Europan' more clear I'll say 'use the notion of 'two spirit'and build upon that'

I'd suggest that generally roles -- whether currently classed in US society as roles of gender, religion, politics, medicine, psychology, what-have-you -- come to exist as the need for such roles come about and that the people appropriately suited for them are available to fill such roles.  When the people and/or need for the roles no longer exist then the roles are no longer filled.      <LF>   In less abstract terms -- and to couch it in terms that more easily fit US/Western gender roles -- when soldiers are needed, the most physically capable rise to fill that need; likewise when tender caring is needed those able to provide that step forward.  It would generally be accepted, then, that should there be a person that can do both, they do do both without question by others in the society because that person is merely 'doing what they do' (and consequently providing the best possible for the society).   <LF>   I would then explain the etymolygy of 'Two-Spirit' (I have no idea which language is the source of this English translation).  (I have to wonder if this term in English was put forth by a non-Native academic researcher, but I digress...)  Finally I would explain that both some Native Americans who would be classed as 'Queer' or 'Trans' (i.e. 'Transsexual' or 'Transgender') in the commonly-held US/Western society and some non-natives are using the 'Two-Spirit' to describe themselves, though they may maintain different meanings for the term.   <LF>   Note that I would not split the ideas as pre/post-invasion (aka pre/post-colonial) or historical/current.  Native American people, cultures, ideas are indeed extant, though their essential elements are not brought out in the commonly-held US/Western society.   <LF>

Of course, they do know both traditional and anglo (two-spirited person, homosexual, transsexual etc.) terms (and there indeed are both â€” still very viable â€” traditional as well as modern, neotraditionalist concepts around), but in talking to you they probably will pick what they think you might understand best.

Make sure the act itself carries the same load for Hopis, or don't use it. &quot;Boys&quot; in that context is also a bit tricky. Not to mention that fertility rites may be something very stange to the average modern western person, but they would have - this one, if it took place, or any other one - carried entirely different connotations to those performing them. Most certainly they cannot be linked to sexual abuse of minors, as your edit implies. And that is the problem - you don't even consider looking at the alleged ritual without imposing your moral judgement on it - and then demand content to be removed because of your moral judgement. But, as far as I know, that has never been a reason to remove content, and I don't really see why we should start that now. If Hopi people say it is not true and are offended by it, then by all means, let's remove that. But not because of some pc-ish &quot;I am sure it must offend them&quot;.

I apologize if I missed them in a previous discussion:   <LF>   (1) This sentence jumped out at me for its inappropriateness: ''Two-spirit people, specifically male-bodied (biologically male, gender female), could go to war and have access to male activities such as sweat lodges. However, they also took on female roles such as cooking and other domestic responsibilities''. ...'''Right there''', in the very sentence itself, it explains why it's inappropriate to refer to TS as &quot;gender female&quot; (or &quot;gender male&quot; for biofem TS, I guess).   <LF>   (2) The intro part about &quot;many, if not most&quot; nations recognizing TS social roles. There doesn't seem to be much in the article to back that up. And, given the enormous cultural differences among American nations, it actually seems a little unlikely. Remember, it isn't just whites who indulge in &quot;they had respect for nature,&quot; etc., romantic bullshit and cultural generalizations. We should be on guard against this kind of thing in this article, and avoid wishful thinking. Which brings up...   <LF>   (3) The list of &quot;modern&quot; TS. The mere fact that they are listed separately from &quot;historical&quot; TS  should set off some alarm bells. How many of these folks are just plain old queer Indians? All the &quot;historical&quot; TSs, presumably (I didn't check the links), operated in a specific social role recognized by their particular national culture (roles which, incidentally, did not correspond very well to identities like &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;transgendered,&quot; and which certainly weren't about blanket respect and freedom for personal sexual identity in the way we now value being &quot;queer-friendly&quot; and &quot;nonjudgmental&quot;). Do all the &quot;modern&quot; TSs listed belong to nations which maintain a role of this sort ''today'', which they are filling? For at least the first modern listed, the answer would seem to be no; she's Mohawk, who are specifically mentioned in the article for not having a TS role (or at least, for having little evidence of such--and if there's doubt about it in the past, it's pretty damn likely there isn't one now). In any case, ''she'' at least seems to &quot;get it&quot;: there's no evidence in the linked article that she identifies as anything but a lesbian.   <LF>   If an Indian is an ''activist'' for promoting social tolerance within their nation ''(This reminds me of another objection: The asininely romantic implication that the white man introduced the American nations to &quot;homophobia&quot; i.e. identity intolerance; it's somewhere in this article, though clearly refuted by other sections)'', and would like to create and fill a social identity role that's inspired by one found in another American nation (or perhaps in the past of their own nation), then God bless them. God bless even the Indians who really just identify as &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;lesbian,&quot; but who are just making an appeal for tolerance and decency in their nation and are invoking the history of &quot;two-spirit&quot; roles to do so. The problem is, this article says ''nothing'', besides the coining of the phrase &quot;TS,&quot; about modern Indian history. Anyone who identifies as TS does indeed deserve to be called that in wikipedia (and by society); but, as it stands, the article leaves the impression that they're simply filling the sort of social role within their nation that's described at length in the article. The distinction must be made.

This is not about transsexuality, but more to do with what we may term today as intersexed or &quot;transgender&quot; in general (cross-dressing to even transsexual-like behavior). &quot;Male-bodied&quot; and &quot;female-bodied&quot; make more sense than &quot;genetically male [or female],&quot; &quot;TS,&quot; &quot;MtF,&quot; &quot;FtM,&quot; etc., which are modern terms that could or can be incorrectly applied to these individuals.

Having read all of the books currently out on this subject, I cannot find a tribe that has explicitly held negative views on these kind of individuals prior to the early 1900s. After this, one cannot overlook the influence from Europeans and Christianity. If you look at the ethnographic reports, the transphobia increases in the early 1900s and reaches its height in the 1940s and 50s. This also coincides with the fact that at this time the disconnect of many tribal members from their traditional ways was at its peak before the civil rights movements ([[American Indian Movement|AIM]] in particular) of the 60s and 70s encouraged many of these indigenous people to reconnect with the old ways of their tribe. If you look at the myths and creation stories of certain tribes during the mid-20th century you can see an influence from Christianity compared to much earlier versions of those same stories. You can never ignore possibilities of acculturation. And yes, there are hundreds of tribes in North America and the differences between tribes can many times be immense. While the argument that this particular &quot;generalization&quot; (your term) is akin to the &quot;noble savage&quot; myth is very wise, it isn't correct. This is why &quot;many, if not most&quot; is used, it certainly does not say &quot;all&quot; or that it assumes such and leaves room for there to be exceptions. With so many different tribes, there's bound to be an exception. This was very much in mind when editing the article.   <LF>   :'''3.'''

In fact, it was the fact that I thought it was a passÃ© label that I figured I could re-appropriate it: I haven't seen the abbreviation too much in print lately; and most people who I've met who would once have been called &quot;transsexuals,&quot; regardless of their race seem to reject it as confining, misleading, etc. for various reasons. But still, a little rash to commit the abbreviation to the dustbin and use it for something else! Sorry we got our wires crossed there.   <LF>   From what I can see, this leaves the real disagreement down to a quibble. Still, for what it's worth, I think &quot;many&quot; is appropriate, but &quot;if not most&quot; might souund borderline weaselly (though I'm sure it wasn't intended that way). Nowhere near a majority of Indian nations have been mentioned in this article, and many are specifically mentioned for having had no sign of such a role. It just strikes me as a prudent, conservative policy to merely make claims about what we have evidence for--which is most certainly &quot;many,&quot; but nowhere near &quot;most.&quot; Let's remember that we're talking about a fairly specific category of social role; the mere absence of phobia in other nations does not indicate that a two-spirit type role should be inferred for them. ...I do, on the other hand, now agree that &quot;homophobia&quot; should indeed be thought of as a European influence. But as for the article, I'd rather see someone attempt an account along the lines you just laid out, talking about how and when Christianity or other influences affected attitudes toward two-spirits. You see this all the time in pop (ie general-audience, like wikipedia) accounts of sex/gender roles and encounters with European-Christian culture: No matter what the time or place of the encounter, or the nature of the social role that was once tolerated, the aboriginal nation's new intolerance is explained as &quot;homophobia.&quot; It's always struck me that with a just a little more effort, they could be a lot more helpful with their descriptio

The quote itself indicates clearly that by &quot;duties&quot; Catlin means precisely that, duties - i.e. not the actual sexual practice and clothing of the Berdache, which are clearly his/her own choice/preference, but the ''work'' s/he performs in the community. Looking at the list in the beginning of the article, this seems to agree with the &quot;gravedigging&quot; bit - it's a disliked duty, one that marginalizes and is given to the marginalized in many cultures; e.g. Gypsies in traditional societies on the Balkans have been given such functions, cf. the fortune-telling bit. BTW, I'll {{fact}} that list, I think its sources should be stated clearly.

This is not what I have come across in my reading of the berdache. In some tribes the woman-man berdache was the exclusive lead mourner and grave digger, while in others it was usually done by regular men or women and only occasionally by a berdache, while in others the berdache had nothing to do with mourning or corpse-handling. The Michachai and Waksachi Yokut women-men were sometimes gravediggers, but only after having a dream that instructed them to do so. For the regular person, why someone became a gravedigger are prosaic; either someone &quot;grew up that way&quot; or had a desire to get rid of the deceased, sometimes dreams were sent by the dead which moved someone to take up the occupation. Among the Michachai and Waksachi the bodies of men had to be carried by men and the bodies of women had to be carried by women, so the berdache was well suited to this task as they could carry both. Among the Lakota the task of carrying the corpse to the burial scaffold was done by elderly women.

As for the dreams issue - well, there's a continuum between being ''forced'' by the community to perform a function because you're marginalized and ''choosing'' to perform a function that is marginal but also privileged (undertaker, witch, hangman) because you're in some way marginalized anyway and have little to lose from that. Of course, these are all my uninformed speculations, largely irrelevant to the specific quote issue.

I don't see why you feel that precisely the Catlin quote, and in the shortened version to boot, is more desirable than all the rest. And I still maintain that the way you had shortened it is misleading and, whatever your intention was, objectively has the effect of concealing information. Catlin may have been wrong in much of what he wrote, but you can't take just the part of his observations that supports your preferred generalization (roughly, the generalization that overall, Indians tolerated and respected LGBTs until the Euros came) and then completely omit the part that directly contradicts it - I can tell you that no matter what one thinks about the proposed generalization itself, this kind of selectivity would be considered cheating in every area of knowledge. As I said, the shortened version conceals the fact that Catlin refers to the Berdache being given degrading duties. It also allots a lot of space to Catlin's Puritanical dislike of the custom, but doesn't actually specify what the custom he disliked was, again according to Catlin's information. It only implies that there was some &quot;dance to the Berdache&quot;, giving the impression that it was a dance performed by the entire grateful community in honour of the highly respected Berdache - so evil Catlin hated it, of course. In fact the entire quote clearly indicates that it was a humorous dance performed only by men who had had sex with the Berdache and boasted of that (whom Catlin accordingly classifies, within his own cultural framework, as &quot;odd fellows&quot;) - true or not, this is a different and much less idyllic picture.

There are many contradictions in his claim. Simply by virtue of being offered a feast, the berdache was accorded a high status. And the men who voluntarily got up to dance did so because there was a certain status in being the sexual partner of the berdache. An even more important element of this dance is that it offered the berdache as opportunity publicly to humiliate any man who dared to dance. Simply by denying past sexual relations the berdache could make a man's dance seem an empty boast. This served as a powerful weapon to ensure that the berdache's partners would not mistreat him, all he had to do was deny having sex with them. Papago men would sometimes boast of having an obscene nickname given to them by a berdache. The Sauk and Fox people had to stay on the good side of the berdache or risk public humiliation. &quot;Evil Catlin&quot; may not be entirely true. Whether his last statement was his personal views is uncertain, he might felt constrained to insert a negative comment to prevent controversy. He had practically invited those who were homosexually-inclined men to go west and see the berdaches for themselves.

You have to be placed in a &quot;weird&quot;, marginalized position in the community (the &quot;village whore&quot;) to find any joy or use in this sort of thing in the first place. Mistreatment by ''non''-partners seems at least as relevant a risk as mistreatment by partners. Not to mention the &quot;Invitation to a Gay Heaven in the Wild West&quot; thing. All in all, I think that both sides of what Catlin says merit consideration. His comment about the berdache being celebrated and regarded as medicine ''because of'' being degraded seems contradictory and is probably partly homophobic, but is not as devoid of plausibility as it could appear. In traditional societies, &quot;freaks&quot; and &quot;outsiders&quot; of all kinds are often ''both'' marginalized and respected, disliked but feared; they are regarded as magical and close to the Great Unknown (Catlin's &quot;medicine&quot;) because they are somehow different, inexplicable. People will view the witch living at the end of the village with a mixture of superstitious fear and contempt, hope and hate. No wonder having had sex with the strange creature is a brave achievement to boast of - cutting its liver out and making it into powder would surely increase one's magical powers as well, just as a toad's or an [[albino]]'s severed organ would. Overall, this sort of &quot;traditional&quot;, &quot;noble and savage&quot; situations are not necessarily idylls from a modern point of view.

Most of these derogatory statements are a result of the influence of white people and their Christian religion. Some anthropologists have been less than clear about recognizing these acculturative influences, and instead have blithely attributed derogatory statements to a supposed aboriginal heritage.''&quot; (pg. 39), &quot;''While the suppression of the berdache tradition originated from the prejudices of white government officials and missionaries, ultimately the changing ideals of Indian people themselves have had the most direct impact on berdaches. Under the devastating impact of the church and the state, traditional religious ceremonies were suppressed and ideology revolutionized. When Indians converted to Christianity, many absorbed Christian notions about the evilness of sex, and disrespect for the shamans and their ceremonies. By internalizing white ideals, they undercut the basis for respect of things they had previously accepted.''&quot; (pg. 187-188), &quot;''In 1944 an ethnographer among the Hopi reported that while homosexuality had formerly been quite common, it was infrequent by the 1930s because of white influences.''&quot; (pg. 188), &quot;''Any tradition that combined both sexuality and traditional religious ideas, like berdachism, received much genocidal pressure.''&quot; (pg. 188), &quot;''Just as the status of Indian women declined with the adoption of patriarchal Christianity, so did berdaches.

No longer is he combining the power of both women and men; in Christianity he is seen as subverting his natural male superiority to take an inferior female form.''&quot; (pg. 189), &quot;''It is not surprising to hear stories such as that recorded about the Winnebago, who had previously treated berdaches as highly honored and respected persons, but who had 'become ashamed of the custom because the white people thought if was amusing or evil.

Missionaries openly condemned all forms of homosexual relations, excluding berdaches from church and from burial in church cemeteries and insisting that Christian Indians have nothing to do with berdache in their community. A Lakota healer described the way that such teachings were internalized: 'When the people began to be influenced by the missions and the boarding schools, a lot of them forgot the traditional ways and the traditional medicine. Then they began to look down on the winkte and lose respect. The missionaries and the government agents said winktes were no good, and tried to get them to change their ways.

General   <LF>   I heartily agree with 24 that descriptions of historical phenomena should reflect academic practice and knowledge, not self-appointed modern &quot;successors&quot; - this is a ubiquitous problem that I've encountered countless times on Wikipedia and in our modern intellectual/cultural life in general. So yes, I'm for academia against activists. BUT there's little we on Wikipedia can do when academia turns activist. Williams is apparently an activist scholar, and Lang is on his side; it seems that things have gone too far in this particular field, and if you want to combat this, you have to become a scholar, not a Wikipedian. On this particular front (Wikipedia), there is precious little that can be done.   <LF>   2. Use of the term &quot;berdache&quot;   <LF>   I agree with 24 that &quot;berdache&quot; has apparently been the accepted anthropological term, while two-spirit is an activist neologism. BUT Wiccalrish and Hyacinth have cited a scholarly source saying that &quot;'Berdache' is now considered to be an inappropriate and insulting term by a number of Native Americans as well as by anthropologists&quot;. This is legitimate. If &quot;berdache&quot; is to be used as 24 wants, then one would at least need to have citations to other modern scholarly sources saying the opposite.   <LF>   3. List and synthesis   <LF>   24 says that &quot;Lang does not claim that all the groups which disapprove only do so because of they were â€œparticularlyâ€ â€œinfluenced by European homophobia/transphobia,â€ as you wrote, and you cannot appeal to more generalized statements by Williams and Swidler to make Lang say that; that is your synthesis and original research.&quot;    <LF>   I agree with 24 - this is obvious OR. BUT if Williams or someone else clearly says that ''all'' Native American homophobia is of White origin - and the quotes from him that Wiccalrish and Hyacinth have adduced are pretty close to saying such a thing, so I suppose that a precise match can easily be found as well - then this can be stated in the article, and the list can come shortly afterwards, leading to the same overall impression.   <LF>   4. Little Thunder   <LF>   24 says that &quot;Beverly Little Thunder is not a reliable source about berdache, or pre-modern Native culture generally, but a â€œNative American lesbian author and activistâ€™:[9][10]   <LF>   Addtionally, youâ€™ve misattributed her essay in what is currently note 23: Jacobs: (1997: 206) should read â€œThunder (1997: 206),â€, and her essay should appear in the bibliography wherever it is used. Not only have you used an activist instead of an academic, youâ€™ve also denied her credit for her writing by passing it off as someone elseâ€™s.&quot;   <LF>   I agree with 24 - this is a POV-ish misattribution. BUT if Jacobs clearly expresses agreement with Thunder's claim - and I wouldn't be surprised if he does - then that can be cited anyway.

These roles included wearing the clothing and performing the work of both male and female genders. The term &quot;two-spirit&quot; usually implies a masculine spirit and a feminine spirit living in the same body and was coined by contemporary gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Native Americans to describe themselves and the traditional roles they are reclaiming. There are many indigenous terms for these individuals in the various Native American languages. According to Gilly, &quot;What scholars generically refer to as 'Native American gender diversity' was a fundamental institution among most tribal peoples.&quot;&lt;br&gt;   <LF>   The fundamental, and possibly incurable, problem with this introduction (and arguably with the article as a whole) is is that it conflates contemporary gay and lesbian and transgender Native Americans with historical berdaches. For example, do these contemporary Two-Spirits &quot;fulfill one of many mixed gender roles found traditionally among many Native Americans and Canadian First Nations indigenous groups,&quot; as stated in the opening sentence? I would be surprised if many did: these roles were tightly circumscribed, and not analogous to contemporary behaviors, which are premised upon individual freedom and choice, and moreover berdaches most classically (i.e. among the Sioux) engaged in sexual relations with (normative as well as biological) men, not with other berdaches.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_3_35/ai_84678614/?tag=content;col1] It is thus deeply misleading to describe berdache roles as &quot;the traditional roles they [contemporary Native American LGBTs] are reclaiming.&quot; Finally, while the Gilly book is about contemporary Native Americans, the quote in context explicitly refers to traditional male berdache roles, not to &quot;gender diversity&quot; in the modern sense. (We might also observe that, though an anthropologist, Gilly's expertise is in Native Americans with AIDS, not traditional American societies, and is a less-than-ideal source for such a sweeping claim

I'm guessing that they're doing it very badly, but it seems pointless to make judgements that here - perhaps it could just be rewritten as &quot;roles that they seek to reclaim&quot;. The lead could state that the term 'Two-Spirit' may refer to two things - historical Native American mixed gender roles (retrospective Politically Correct use of the term) and those modern LGBT Native Americans who seek to wholly or partly emulate them (synchronic use of the term). I also agree the Gilly quote is kinda stupid (the modern concept of 'gender diversity' presupposes flexibility and individuality, while the Native American roles were rigidly defined), and his lack of expertise is an additional argument to remove it. But all in all, there isn't much that can be improved here, as far as I can see.

For starters, the standard plural of Ojibwe &quot;manidoo&quot; is not &quot;manidoowag&quot; but &quot;manidoog&quot;. I have never heard an exception to this in spoken usage. I have also searched a vast corpus of Ojibwe texts from all known dialect regions going back to the 19th century and I have yet to find an exception to this. Secondly, the Ojibwe literally translates as &quot;two spirits&quot;. I would be interested to see a citation of the use of this phrase with the meaning claimed in a historical (pre-1990) sentence by a fluent Ojibwe speaker. It does not sound like natural Ojibwe to me. I'm not a native speaker of Ojibwe, but based on my knowledge of the language it seems if such an idea were to be communicated in Ojibwe, it would be more natural to say something like (and I am definitely just guessing here) &quot;oniizhomanidoowi&quot;, i.e. to express it as a verb form (and then to make a participle from the verb). The preference for naming everything with noun phrases is an English bias and adds to the suspicion that the Ojibwe is the calque of the English, not the other way around. The bias of Ojibwe is to express such ideas with verbs. However, I have never seen any such word in any shape, so if it is historically attested, some citation should be provided. I have asked a number of fluent speakers the traditional words that might be used to express queer, trans, gay, etc. and so far have not heard one - let alone any variation on &quot;niizh manidoowag&quot;. There are official neologisms like &quot;wiijininiimaagan&quot;, but everyone recognizes these to be recent coinages.    <LF>   In John Tanner's autobiography the word &quot;a-go-kwa&quot; is used, which in modern double-vowel orthography would be written as egokwe or possibly egookwe. The -kwe element means woman, but I don't know what the ego- or egoo- part means. And understanding the cultural sense of the term relies on a lot of retrospective interpretation. However, you can read this section of John Tanner's narrative here: http://books.google.ca/books?id=mQ8AAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=john%20tanner&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=a-go-kwa&amp;f=false    <LF>   In any case, without a persuasive citation of the historical usage of the words &quot;niizh manidoowag&quot; I think any claim that they are the origin of the English expression cannot be supported.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

The cited journalistic source appears to derive from this Wikipedia entry. Passages of the source strongly resemble passages of this article, so it cannot be considered a persuasive source, given the arguments above.

Further, neither of these citations, in which the putative term is presented in a body of English text, is persuasive evidence of its currency in the Ojibwe language. Also, the grammatical problems that cast doubt on the origin of the term have not been addressed. The problem is the etymology is being used to legitimize the English term, but it appears to be a false etymology.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

A more meaningful statement about economic growth is already in the article and reads: ''Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis''. Here we talk about a period of years not just one. Furthermore it seems that the only purpose of this sentence is to add the claim that Peru is the fastest growing nation in South America which is not very humble, not very relevant (one year you can be on top and the next not) and quite chauvinistic.    <LF>   ::*The most recent poverty figure is already in the article, what's the point of having the last three years? Sure, poverty has receded but it can grow back as easily. The bit on poverty in the added paragraph seems an excess of triumphalism.   <LF>   ::*The same goes for the bit on government forecasts, these are just predictions, not hard data. It is not certain that they'll come true. Plus, it seems totally inappropriate to use an encyclopedic article to voice the president's opinions on how good is government is.     <LF>   ::*On the Stock Exchange, I think this is quite irrelevant as only a tiny minority of Peruvian enterprises actively participate in the Stock Exchange so it does not say much about the economy of the country as a whole. Furthermore, it seems the only point of this sentence is to mention that it is one of the fastest growing stock exchanges in the world, that is, more nationalism   <LF>   ::*As for inflation, I'd say the same arguments mentioned about economic growth apply here.    <LF>

For example if I had written ''&quot;inflation is the lowest in south america at 1.8% making Peru the best economy to invest in South America&quot;'' I could see your point but all I have written are actual facts that are relevant and not added extra adjectives or my own personal opinions. And as nationalism is based on personal opinions what I have written has no relation to nationalism. Additionally, the CIA world factbook served as a refrence for some of my figures and I dont see why the CIA would have Peruvian nationalistic feelings. As for the stock exchange many of the largest mining companies in Peru are listed on this exchange and mining is the largest contigent of the Peruvian economy. Additionally, in any economy a stock exchange is always an important contigent, no matter the overall impact it has. Nevertheless, the companies listed on the BVL are not a &quot;tiny minority&quot; of Peruvian entersprises. I have noticed your concern to do anything to &quot;deteriorate&quot; the article from its current state compromising its recognition as a featured article on wikipedia. I do not beleive that it is a reason to delete information off an article just because of a certain &quot;status&quot; on wikipedia. Regarding some of the claims that some of the figures are unneccecary due to them being not permanent I had thought I solved that according to [[WP:RECENTISM]] by adding an economic history section. Anyways I do not see why listing current economic data goes against [[WP:RECENTISM]] if it is not the only time period that data is listed for.    <LF>

As for the rest:   <LF>   :*On the stock exchange the claim that ''mining is the largest contigent (sic) of the Peruvian economy'' is a commons misconception. As you can see on [http://www.bcrp.gob.pe/bcr/Memoria-Anual/Memoria-2006.html this report] by the Peruvian Central Bank (see page 204) mining is smaller than agriculture, manufacturing, trade, others services and taxes as a percentage of the GDP. It is only bigger than construction (barely) and fishing so basically the Lima Stock Exchange is still small and not very representative of the economy as a whole.   <LF>   :*Now on WP:RECENTISM, the problem with putting one year figures for economic growth or inflation is that these numbers don't say much about the country as they only represent the rate of change over the last year. If you say the economy of X country grew 4% you don't give much meaningful info about that country's economy: is it big? is it small? is it undergoing a process of sustainable growth? is that growth temporary, or has it been continuous over the years? Those kind of important questions are not answered, instead, the sentence focus on just the rate of change over the last year. This seems to me like WP:RECENTISM as it stresses fairly recent events over a more balanced view.   <LF>   :For these regions I think these statements should not be added to the article.

Victor12, you comment that the Amerindian group &quot;happens to be the main contriutor to the current Peruvian demographic composition,&quot; but the article itself states: '' 45% Amerindian, 37% Mestizo (mixed Amerindian and European), 15% White, and 3% black, Japanese, Chinese ''. So by 8% the article is only going to include solely the stereotypical picture of an Amerindian woman, while completely ignoring the Mestizo population. I don't think that's the right thing to do.

BTW, blond people are quite rare in Peru, so this is hardly a representative depiction of Peruvian demographics. As for the Amerindians being the main contributors to the current composition of the Peruvian population I think the numbers are pretty obvious, the &quot;mestizo&quot; group is just the mixture of Amerindian and European so they are also Amerindian to a large extent as you can see by comparing estimates of the native population at the time of the Conquest (even taking into account its demographic collapse) with the numbers of white immigrants to Peru. Besides the current picture is a very good one so I can't see why it bothers you so much to have it in the article.

As I mentioned in my earlier statement, &quot;if this picture is not satisfactory [...],&quot; which makes your &quot;BTW [...]&quot; an unnecessary overstatement. &quot;Mestizo&quot; is not the same thing as Amerindian, because if you're going to say that they are &quot;Amerindian to a large extent,&quot; then I can also claim that they are ''European to a large extent''. A Mestizo is a mixture of both Amerindians and Europeans, as you stated. What bothers me about the current picture is that it is a '''stereotypical''' depiction of Peruvian demographics. I am not asking for the picture to be removed, I'm asking for either a Mestizo to be pictured separately in that same section or for a picture with a better demonstration of Peruvian demographics to be pictured.

It is quite evident that European immigration could not compare numerically to the native Amerindian population. So, by the numbers alone it is quite clear that Amerindian is the main component of the Peruvian demographics. If that is so I fail to see why you claim this pic to be stereotypical. As for having another pic in this section I don't think the text is big enough to have two pics without going against the Wikipedia Manual of Style, that is without sandwiching text between images.

The context includes:   <LF>   '''Ethnic Politics:'''   <LF>   The rise of the indigenous left in Latin America. Examples include the election of ethnically native presidents in Venezuela and Bolivia, the Zapatista movement in Mexico (related to resistance to free trade agreements as well as historic oppression of indigenous people) and in Peru itself, the (often coerced) involvement of Andean natives in the Shining Path movement, and the current support of the Andean people to etnocentric and nationalist para-militar groups such as the Etnocacerista movement of Antauro Humala (The take over of a police station in the town of Andahuaylas in 2005 by the Etnocacerista movement had the support of the mayority of the town's population). The events in Peru are of course related to the Kayapo resistance in Brazil, and similar efforts in Southeast Asia; there is also a parallel with the Nigerian tribal resistance to oil exploitation and resulting environmental damage.   <LF>   '''Ecological Politics:'''   <LF>   The environmental / Green movement tends to represent the interests and concerns of 'First World' Caucasians of middle and upper economic strata, and generally limits its tactics and strategies to counterproductive deals with the corporate sector, lobbying (usually without lasting or substantial success) for legislation, and occasional symbolic ritualized confrontations (e.g., Greenpeace presence in whaling operations, anti-nuclear civil disobedience). However, the Peruvian resistance is part of a 500-year-long struggle of colonized peoples to defend their ancient ways of life, which depend on a viable ecosystem with autonomous species living life on their own terms. Since they're facing genocide in most cases, and negotiated agreements are almost invariably broken by their conquerors, these people rarely have the option of moderation.   <LF>   '''Economics:'''   <LF>   Pressures on rainforests and other natural resources were increased severely by the 1965-1985 era of World Bank loans and IMF demands, and since 1985 by so-called free trade agreements. The Peruvian government's efforts to accelerate the exploitation of the Amazon are presumably an effort to bring Peru into 'the new global economy'. Only when the real value of the Amazon is recognized by the global financial system will the real value of the tribal resistance be fully appreciated.   <LF>   I don't know enough about the recent events, or about Peru, to contribute the section that's needed. But it seems obvious that these events are of great historical significance, and not only for Peru itself.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

The relationship of those functional domains to Peruvian language policies is also explored. An introductory section provides background information on the principles and purposes of language planning, describes Peru's population and the history of its language use and distribution, and reviews recent literature on diglossia and language status planning. The functional domains of Quechua are then outlined in the context of current theory, and ways in which the domains affect Quechua's status in a Spanish-dominated society are considered, particularly in the formation of language policy. It is concluded that despite predictions that Quechua is headed for extinction, there is potential for maintenance of the language in some domains, such as provincial or group domains. While Quechua will never again be the dominant language, it will continue to be valued by the highland communities that continue to speak it. Development of a national daily newspaper, magazine, or radio program in Quechua is suggested as a means of heightening awareness and visibility of the languag

Thus, I think Porras should be left to stand on its own in that section.

They represent three of the main or traditional racial groups that exist in Peru. However, I find it rather insulting to have only full names for individuals of mainly afro and European descent. We should choose a representative and recognizable individual of mainly indigenous or Quechua extraction displaying his or her full name!!. Options could be Alejandro Toledo, Alberto Pizango, Magaly Solier, MartÃ­n Chambi, etc, etc. One more detail, If I am not wrong the number of Afro and Asian Peruvians are very similar. Thus, by not including Asian Peruvians in the mix we are discriminating against this group. Again there are several examples of Asian Peruvians from Alberto and Keiko Fujimori to Erasmo Wong.    <LF>

In this case we have Jefferson Farfan, who is a symbol of both Peruvian sports and the Afro-Peruvian. The article also shows Mantilla, a European Peruvian who serves mainly to show Peruvian women (Yes, she is a former model, so it's a bit of a tongue-in-cheek picture). Ideally, if you can find a better picture of these demographic groups, there would be no need to have notable people.   <LF>   :In regards to Asians, remember that we have to include currently famous people. In this aspect Wong is not currently notable.

However, they are not the only Asian Peruvians. They seem to be very active in the making of the Peruvian culinary boom. e.g. Javier Wong (who is often described as a guru of Peruvian ceviche), Humberto Sato (owner of Costanera 700 arguably the best sea food restaurant in the country). Regarding the picture of the man from Pisac I actually like it and I will put it on it's own. However, the way this selection was chosen or edited might misled, unintentionally, some readers into thinking that there is not any notable Peruvian of mainly indigenous background. Chee

First, this presents the Peruvian population as if it could be split into several discrete entities. (I have no problems, in general, with the word &quot;multiethnic&quot;, except when -- as seems to be the case here -- it is used to reinforce an impression that society can in fact be divided into separate &quot;ethnicities&quot;; this is never fully the case, and in Peru's case it is rather far from the truth.) Now, while racial discrimination is certainly still a part of the realities of life in Peru, it is also the case that Peruvians live in a very mixed society; there are, say, class lines, but these have at most a 'correlation' with phenotype.   <LF>   Key points:   <LF>   * Very few Peruvians descend from a single human group.    <LF>   * Putting &quot;mestizo&quot; alongside other groups does not solve the problem. &quot;Mestizo&quot; denotes a separate caste, if you wish, which did exist in Colonial times, or a more vaguely defined social stratum that had some reality in much of the highlands up to the mid-20th century. (Even in the highlands, your mileage could vary; in my perception, society in, for example, Cajamarca tended to perceive itself mostly along the lines of 'vecinos' vs. 'campesinos', where the latter could very well be of largely Spanish extraction.)   <LF>   * The notion of &quot;ethnic group&quot;, as a popular concept, is arguably a mid-20th Anglo-Saxon invention that did not have much currency in Peru until very recently.    <LF>   * Shortly after independence, the Republic abolished the notion of a division of citizens into two separate bodies of &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;Spaniards&quot;, at least in the official ideology. Of course, reality lagged far behind for a long time; still, this classical liberal notion of citizenship - not the notion of &quot;ethnicity&quot; - was the ideology inculcated at school.   <LF>   * Race has not, as far as I am aware, used in the census for half a century. (This is why the &quot;Indian/White&quot; percentages sometimes given are from so far back.)   <LF>   * Peruvians are not Europeans, Africans or Asians; they can *descend* from Europeans, Africans or Asians.   <LF>   * &quot;European&quot; linked to the controversial page &quot;White Latin American&quot;. It is a reality of life that having a light complexion (preferably associated with some money) will get you classified as &quot;white&quot; in some people's minds, and this will affect your life in some (possibly both positive and completely unwelcome) ways. However, stating that &quot;White Latin Americans&quot; are an objectively existing, well-defined group is much more controversial. There are people who imagine themselves to be white, surely.

The introduction is nothing more than a summary of what is presented in the article. The first paragraph of the Demographics section is what contains the relevant information to this particular paragraph in the introduction. I included the term &quot;Mestizo&quot; because not only is it still used in Peru (and other parts of Latin America; and even by the CIA as can be seen in the [[Mestizo]] article), but because I do believe that most Peruvians fall into that category (from personal experience; of course, the larger number still being the Amerindians). However, as you challenged it and the term is not validated in the Demographics section, then I removed it as well.   <LF>   ::Taking your point into account, what I find an easy solution the matter would be to include &quot;descendants of&quot; after the word &quot;including&quot; (i.e., &quot;The Peruvian population, estimated at 29.5 million, is multiethnic, including '''descendants of''' Amerindians, Europeans, Africans, and Asians).

Regarding the demographics subsection I noticed that the images in the section comprise of a black Peruvian and two white Peruvians.

The pictures are meant to display ''current notable'' Peruvians (in a world sense, not just Peru). The image of ''Maria Julia Mantilla'' should no longer be on it since her notability has diminished, but no one has found a better image so far. If you can find a better image of a current non-white notable Peruvian (preferably a female), then go ahead and change it. The image should preferably have a left-leaning angle, but a forward picture (like the ''Vargas Llosa'' one) is good as well.   <LF>   :So, as you can tell, it's a complicated matter. Perhaps you might wonder ''why'' we are using ''current notable'' Peruvians? I was the one that made the change as, whichever way you look at it, using &quot;notable&quot; or &quot;non-notable&quot; individuals are discriminative forms of stereotyping a society. In other words, it's equally stereotypical to pick a &quot;notable&quot; or a &quot;non-notable&quot;. What makes the difference is that the &quot;notables&quot; are actually relevant persons (most people looking at the article can click on their names and learn more about them), whereas &quot;non-notables&quot; do not have that option.   <LF>   :Finally, please do not include any currently-active political figures (especially possible presidential candidates).

First, we should never use a site such as [http://www.amautaspanish.com/] as a source - this is a commercial Spanish language school being used as a source on the Peruvian constitution. As a source it would never pass FA (or hopefully GA). Secondly, the paragraph &quot;The majority of towns, cities and villages have its own official cathedral or church and patron saint. Particular religious days are noted annually. These forms of activities are focal events and play central roles in the life of all sizes and kinds of community. The costs for the said affairs depend on the size of the community. Both spiritual devotion and hope are to serve in community affairs for prestige and possibly political purposes. The most famous of these activities are the patron festivals that are celebrated yearly. Peruâ€™s constitution gives its citizen religious freedom.&quot; seems unnecessary and maybe confusing. What is an &quot;official cathedral or church and patron saint&quot;? If these are actually official, ie the town or city has made an official statement, that needs to be clarified. Secondly, do we need to tell people all this and if so is this the best way to do it? Of course religious celebrations are held, that's part of almost every religion (although not all). Obviously costs vary according to size of the community (although presumably this isn't always the case, a rich small community may be able to afford more than a larger poor one).

Seeweed is not used in peru at all.   <LF>   Please replace the pic with a real pic.    <LF>   We have seen in Peru a persistent attempt by the Japanese to change Peru's gastronomic history in order to try to claim a link to Peru and its culture.    <LF>   I am 100% peruvian.   <LF>   [[File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link=]] '''Not done:''' Please make your request for a new image to be uploaded to [[Wikipedia:Files for upload|Files For Upload]].

Does not reflect the actual claims of Peruvian territory by those times, and Tubmbes, Jaen and Maynas appear as &quot;Ecuadorian&quot; (in a year when Ecuador did not even exist) the map is inaccurate, biased and chauvinist, and what's worst, places Peruvian cities (Jaen, Iquitos, etc) that have been 100% Peruvian since ancient times, in foreign territory.

Lactase activity is high and vital during infancy, but in most mammals, '''including most humans''', lactase activity declines after the weaning phase. In other healthy humans, lactase activity persists at a high level throughout adult life, enabling them to digest lactose as adults. This dominantly inherited genetic trait is known as lactase persistence. The distribution of these different lactase phenotypes in human populations is highly variable and is controlled by a polymorphic element cis-acting to the lactase gene. A putative causal nucleotide change has been identified and occurs on the background of a very extended haplotype that is frequent in Northern Europeans, where lactase persistence is frequent. This single nucleotide polymorphism is located 14 kb upstream from the start of transcription of lactase in an intron of the adjacent gene MCM6. This change does not, however, explain all the variation in lactase expression.''   <LF>   I've also added a couple of cites to the article.  It's true that most northern Europeans, and thus most Americans, who are largely descended from northern Europeans, have adult lactose tolerance.  This is due to a mutation in northern Europe that seems to have happened after domestication of cattle, and use of dairy in the diet in that area around 7000 years ago.  However, Europeans are a minority of the world population; east Asians and central Africans, for example, are largely lactose intolerant in adulthood, and are more numerous in the world population.  &lt;small&gt;â€”

It may be that the hard cheese that you have eaten still contains levels of lactose that you are intolerant to, ask your doctor to conduct a â€œskin prickâ€ test in which a small amount of dairy [[antigen]]s is poked into a spot on your skin, if you have a allergy to dairy products you will get a rash at that spot, if not then your reaction to dairy products is more likely due to intolerance. It may be possible that you may have both a dairy allergy and lactose intolerance, this would mean positive results for both a prick test and a medical lactose intolerance test. A dairy allergy though is a much more serious problem then lactose intolerance, as accidental ingestion of dairy products could cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic shock]].

That is, did the mutation travel from Europe to India, or vice versa, or is it perhaps an independent mutation? Many Indian languages are related to European languages -- that is, the Indo-European language family includes most European languages and about half of all Indian languages.

Well, duh!  If you're lactose intolerant and never drink milk, there's a good chance all the intestinal bacteria which digest lactose will die off and not be present.  Then if you drink one glass of milk, the lactose has a good chance of passing entirely through the digestive system without incident.  I know from personal experience, though, that if a lactose intolerant adult tries this on a regular basis, the lactose digesting bacteria will soon be back and you'll be back to having symptoms from as little as a tablespoon of milk.

According to the article lactose tolerance developed independently in Europe and East Africa and yet all three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) are shaded in the &quot;91%-100% intolerant&quot; colour.  Also, a slew of countries in West and Central Africa are apparently mostly lactose tolerant despite the article stating that Sub-Saharan Africans are generally lactose intolerant.  The only   reasoning I could find in the article for this was that these countries all seem to be in the geographical distribution of the Fulani people, who, according to the article, are mostly lactose tolerant.  But the Fulani are an ethnic minority in these countries, so their rate of lactose tolerance would not be indicative of the rate of lactose tolerance in the general population.  One other issue is that in South Africa nearly 20% of the population has at least some European ancestry (whites and coloureds), the majority of which is northern European.  And lactose tolerance being a &quot;dominant&quot; gene wouldn't that indicate that a person with full or partial northern European ancestry would most likely be lactose tolerant?  This would put the figures of lactose intolerance lower than &quot;91%-100%&quot;. In general I feel like if most of the African countries are just &quot;rough guesses&quot; than the information shouldn't really be ther

Advan.   <LF>   Med. (Japan.) 72: 323, 1970.   <LF>   *[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=3857498]   <LF>   The relative frequency of acquired primary hypolactasia has been determined in adult Maoris, Samoans and Europeans by measuring an alteration in breath hydrogen concentration two hours after a 50 g oral lactose load. By this indirect measurement hypolactasia was present in 64% of Maoris, 54% of Samoans and 9% of Europeans. The differences between Maoris and Europeans (p less than 0.001) and between Samoans and Europeans (p less than 0.001) were significant.   <LF>   *[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1247927]   <LF>   Lactose malabsorption was studied by a breath hydrogen technique in 139 Samoan and 68 white schoolchildren. The Samoans were studied in four locations, two in Western Samoa and two in New Zealand, and the white children in both the Cook Islands and New Zealand. The prevalence of malabsorption varied with location: for Samoans it ranged from 41% to 60% in Western Samoa and 0% to 35% in New Zealand; white children had rates of 27% in the Cook Islands and 5% in New Zealand. Environmental factors rather than genetic factors are likely to play the main part in initiating if not perpetuating lactose malabsorption. In both races lactose malabsorption had no effect on the acceptance of, consumption of, and number of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by milk and milk biscuits. Children who had symptoms after consuming a particular dairy product were more likely to say they disliked it than those who reported no symptoms.   <LF>   *[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=475426]   <LF>   The breath hydrogen test (BHT) was adapted for use in young infants and children. The diagnostic criterion of sugar malabsorption in the BHT was determined by oral administration of 0.5 g/kg of unabsorbable sugar (lactulose) to 21 healthy infants and children. A maximum increase in breath hydrogen less than 0.05 ml/min per m2 was observed in all subjects. A good correlation between results by the BHT and by the ordinary lactose tolerance test was obtained after oral administration of 2 g/kg lactose to 21 healthy infants and children, 2 congenital lactase-deficient infants, and 7 adults. Using this test, 80 healthy Japanese infants and children (aged between one month and 15 years) and 18 adults were examined for lactose malabsorption after a dose of 1 g/kg lactose. All infants and children under 2-years old absorbed lactose completely. The incidence of lactose malabsorption was 30% in 3-year, 36% in 4-year, 58% in 5-year, and 86% in 6-year-old children, 85% in schoolchildren, and 89% in adults. Thus the incidence of lactase deficiency gradually increases with age from 3 years, and about 90% of all normal Japanese adults are lactase-deficient.   <LF>   *[http://www.mgwater.com/gacontro.shtml]   <LF>   1.

I'll agree that there has been a notable increase of lactose-free dairy products.  I can get lactose-free milk and at this time of year eggnog everywhere, and I'm not limited in choice either.  I can get fatfree, 1%, 2&amp; or regular milk, and there are multiple companies.  I also know that there is lactose free cheese and ice-cream carried at some specialty places though soy is much more common.  There are a few products which utilize lactose free products--there is a frozen mac and cheese which is lactose free.  But I've never seen lactose free cottage cheese, or anything else really.  And the only thing that I can get with ease is milk and eggnog.  Cheese and ice cream are harder to find.   <LF>   I can get almost everything soy--soy ice cream, sour cream, cream cheese, milk, eggnog, yoghurts and cheeses of every variety, everything.  And while having a soy alternative for every product in existence is nice, it's not the same as having lactose free milk products.  I'm really confused by this article saying that there has been a resurgence starting 16, or well now 17 years ago, that includes products I simply can't find 17 years later  '

It also seems to imply that lactose intolerance has something to do with political division: why does the Democratic Republic of the Congo have a prevalence of 11-20%, while their (also mainly Bantu) neighbors have 81-90%? What's that mysterious line that abruptly divides France in 11-20% and 61-70%?

And it might even be of a little use to give an idea of how much lactose an &quot;average&quot; intolerant person can tolerate.  But the main thrust should be to give a clear concept of the great range of tolerance among the intolerant.

But milk or ice cream in the evening lead to &quot;intestinal distress&quot;.  Maybe just because the milk with the oatmeal is a small amount.

Such products include commercial [[sausage]]s (notably frankfurters), medications which may contain lactose as a filler, most meal replacement powders and protein bars, cottage cheese, many &quot;granola&quot; style cereals, pancakes, crepes, custards, 90% of margarines (added for texture), 70% of flavored potato/corn chips (added as an adhesive for the spices), most frozen meals, &quot;double wrapped&quot; sliced bread, some dried fruit, even yogurts containing [[carageenan]] or [[gelatin]], at the other end, full fat yogurts are nearly lactose free.   <LF>   :It is of great use to understand that because lactose is a water soluble molecule, milk based dairy products have more lactose than cream based dairy products: full ice creams, real camembert, real brie, full fat sour cream, full fat yogurts, butter, etc contain little to no lactose.  Conversely &quot;low fat&quot; and &quot;diet&quot; dairy products are rife with lactose, especially products like &quot;I can't believe it's not butter&quot;, which is mostly buttermilk, is very high in lactose! The upside of it is that the partially tolerant amongst us can still eat the most interesting dairy foods, i.e. butter and whipped cream, as long as it's not the diet version! The word &quot;skim milk&quot; on any ingredient list should be avoided at all costs. Since lactose is a sugar, you can get an indication of the lactose content of any dairy product by checking the nutritional analysis.  For many butters and cheeses, the sugar content is zero or less than 0.1%, showing that they must either be free of lactose or contain only a negligible amount.   <LF>   ; Statements by editors previously involved in dispute   <LF>   * Please see correspondence in [[User_talk:Sagie#Lactose Intolerance]] and [[User_talk:Tallard#Your_contribution_to_.5B.5BLactose_intolerance.5D.5D]].   <LF>   ; Comments   <LF>   * The argument of user [[User:Sagie|Sagie]] is that these paragraphs is in clear defiance of Wikipedia's policies plainly presented in [[WP:V|Verifiability]] and [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought]].   <LF>   :The contributing user [[User:Tallard|Tallard]] has contributed original research (verified as original research by himself/herself, see [[User_talk:Sagie#Lactose Intolerance|here]]) and claims that his contribution need not comply to the aformentioned policies due to:   <LF>

Even the remaining material, in fact, belies its irrelevance to the topic at hand with its talk of milk allergies. As the responsible portions of this article make clear, lactose intolerance is akin to the discomfort from foods like [[beano|beans]]; most patients can consume a serving of milk per day with other foods, and ''none'' have to go about exercising the kind of caution appropriate to food allergies or celiac disease--worrying about &quot;negligible dairy residues&quot; remaining on processing equipment after cleaning, and so forth.   <LF>   :::::Even if this weren't the case, in fact, the passage is nakedly nonsensical.

Which is why I rewrote the paragraph to take any medical presumption out of it. Now it's strictly a food tolerance paragraph. But the fact is most doctors do not bother performing the above cited diagnostic tests on regular patients, they just say live with it or take supplements, because lactose intolerance is not considered a medical disease. So as long as this paragraph remains in the food realm there is not reproachable. Furthermore, this section used to be 4 paragraphs long.

Those antibiotics killed a large amount of my normal intestinal bacteria and allowed [[c. difficile]] to proliferate, which was preventing me from properly digesting food.

The enzyme, Î²-galactosidase, is available in tablet form in a variety of doses, in many countries without a prescription. It functions well only in high-acid environments, such as that found in the human gut due to the addition of gastric juices from the stomach.&quot;   <LF>   But accoriding to a different article called &quot;Beta-galactosidase&quot; (I'd add the link, but I don't know how), &quot;Lactase is often confused as an alternate name for Î²-galactosidase, but it is actually simply a sub-class of Î²-galactosidase.&quot; So isn't this article just saying that the enzyme Lactase is available in pill form? And if that's the case, how does the enzyme, which has an optimum Ph level of 6.5, survive the low 1-2 Ph of stomach acid without being denatured?

How do you come up with 70-75% of the world population (4.5 billion people) being Lactose intolerant?   <LF>   i believe this to be a relatively accurate estimate if you factor in the amount of people that will suffer some form of lactose intolerance with age, people tend to gain some malabsorption problem with age and a key one is lactose intolerance via a lactose persistance.   <LF>   2. How accurate is this estimate?  I have seen very little hard evidence except in major countries regarding Lactose Intolerance.  This assumption seems to exclude Japanese from lactose tolerance, but Japanese stats show hugely increased milk consumption as do Australian dairy stats for exports to Japan.  How is it the Japanese can NOW digest dairy products contrary to received scientific wisdom?   <LF>   3. Indians are known to be lactose tolerant and we know of the sacred cows of India.  Pakistan and Bangladesh are also of the same background.  This is a huge part of the world population.  Add North America and Europe.  Add about half of South America.   <LF>   4. China is now encouraging the consumption of milk and dairy products.  So far, I have not heard of an epidemic of dead Chinese due to Lactose Intolerance.   <LF>   5. Define Lactose Intolerance.  The word intolerance is absolute.  The implication is lactose intolerant people cannot eat and cannot digest dairy products.  Obviously there are varying degrees of digestibility.   <LF>   6. What are the true facts behind the statistics.  What size are the samples?  Where are the samples from?   I have read at wrongdiagnosis.com that the stats on Lactose Intolerance are suspect and depend upon extrapolations of data from a very few western countries.   <LF>   7. Many cultures which herded cattles and goats are able to digest lactose--this includes African and Mongolian herding cultures.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

Some decrease in lactose activity is not the same as being intolerant.   <LF>   I am concerned that there are claims that certain cheeses have very low lactose tolerances, and the reference is the website &quot;ilovecheese.com&quot; - a lobbying group whose primary goal is to increase the demand for cheese.

I'm confused by it. Judging by the talk page, so are a lot of people. They come to the article looking for information on a medical condition, and they're confused by all the talk of percentages and what's &quot;normal&quot;; or they come here looking for information on an evolutionary trait, and they find only jumbled lists of statistics using inconsistent terminology. I think the core problem is that this article conflates several concepts: lactose intolerance, lactose malabsorption, lactase deficiency and lactase persistence. Not without reason of course; they're all facets of the same phenomena. But because those facets fall into different areas of academic study there are wide discrepancies in approach and terminology, discrepancies which this article makes a bit of a mess of dealing with. My proposal is that this article will only see significant improvement if it is able to commit to one approach, one set of terminology, and therefore it must be split into two:   <LF>   * '''Lactose intolerance''', the medical condition - with a brief summary of the prevalence of lactose intolerance around the world, but mainly focusing on the biological action, diagnosis, nutrition and treatment.   <LF>   * A new article, '''lactase persistence''', dealing with the ability to digest milk in adulthood as an evolutionary novelty in some human populations. So to start with it would consist of the current second and fourth sections (there's a lot more I'd like to add to this though).   <LF>   I think the result would be two much cleaner, much more coherent, and much more understandable articles. â€”

No more than menopause is a 'medical condition'. Some women are menopaused very early, others very late, but menopause is natural.

Indeed awareness of the phenomenon, or condition (in the broad sense - as in 'life is a condition') likely arose from medical inquiries into why some people could tolerate milk and some reacted badly (we now know that lactase persistence is a minority condition and lactose intolerance a majority one - but this is retrospecive knowledge). A great deal of our knowledge of human biology arose as a derivative of medical inquiry, and so has been subsumed into the dominant medical paradigm of the time, including attempts to answer questions like &quot;how can we treat this condition?&quot; in the narrow, medical sense. Research funding is another factor: research is not cheap. The researcher may be interested in broader questions than the funder, who or which has to get a return for expenditure. We now know of course that lactose intolerance and lactase persistence are two sides of the same coin, and that the broadest relevant paradigms pertain to evolutionary biology and overlapping areas such as anthropology (both of which in turn have overlapping subsets in medicine). But this awareness is after-the-fact of a body of knowledge built up under the medical paradigm. It's not really an issue: an astute researcher will always encounter relevant information in all sorts of areas under all sorts of paradigms, some of which are sound and some outdated or even ludicrous.

There very well could be errors, and even if not the lack of detailed sources for the statistics is problematic. But it seems to be the best freely-available map of LI available. Unfortunately preparing an alternative map is not as simple as looking up a figure for a country and colouring it in appropriately; there's lots of conflicting data that can't be really be put together. Some studies look at the modern population (useful from a medical POV) while others will only look at the indigenous people of a given area (useful from an evolutionary POV). Older studies may have methodological problems, particularly with regard to sampling, since before the 1970s the significant variation in LI between ethnicities was not widely known. Some populations have detailed stratified statistics available (e.g. the US), others only have broad regional surveys. In much of Africa, the Near East, and East Asia, doing things on a national basis would obscure considerable variation among ethnicities within a single country. Additionally, there's a range of ways you can define lactose intolerance, and although choosing one or the other could change the final figure by tens of percent, studies rarely say outright which one they are using. In other words, putting together a map that displays all the information in a way that is both accurate and ''consistent'' is a not a simple task. â

It could be that you live in, or your family originally come from, an area of Italy that has a lower frequency of lactose intolerance than the national average (e.g. the north, uplands). Also, since lactose intolerance is primarily genetic, it's not surprising that the majority of the members of a family would have the same phenotype (non-lactose intolerance in this case). The typical Italian breakfast doesn't say much either: there's not enough milk in coffee to trigger symptoms in most lactose intolerant people, and cheese actually contains a very small amount of lactose because the lactose is turned into lactic acid in the fermentation process.   <LF>   ::80â€“90% would be high.

Other studies cited in the article say 51% for northern Italians and anywhere from 4% to 72% of Sicilians.

On reading Arjamaa &amp; Vuorisalo's 2010 article [http://www.csub.edu/~kgobalet/files/Bio470/Arjamaa&amp;Vuorisalo%202010%20Gulture-Genes.pdf &quot;Gene-Culture Coevolution and Human Diet&quot;], I noted that their lactose intolerance global distribution map was adapted from Wikimedia Commons. This intrigued me, and a brief search for such a map in Wikipedia/media brought me to the above article. I had noted the absence of such a map in this lactose intolerance article, which I thought was remiss: a global distribution graphic is indispensible for concept/information transmission to a broad audience. A bit more reading of this talkpage and I see there was indeed a distribution map up until [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lactose_intolerance&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=434284069 8 June 2011], after which it was deleted by a relatively new editor on [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lactose_intolerance&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=433143188 14 June 2011] on the basis of being inaccurate and misleading.   <LF>   :I note your own comments on the difficulty of devising a reliable map, given the methodological variations and limitations underpinning available data, and of course you make some good points, all of which I recognised from the time when I delved into epidemiological issues. The prevailing map for some time was that produced by Kretchmer in 1972, which I encountered in the early 90's and which continues to be cited. A workable solution regarding the map may well arise from answering the question: &quot;in terms of available distribution data, what has remained stable, what has changed, and what is changing?&quot; I must note (for some editors) that I am talking of available data, NOT phenomena for which we have yet to capture data. The latter is the arena of of primary researchers, the former that of encyclopedias such as this, and on which we need therefore concentrate our efforts.   <LF>   :Answering this may lead to say, three or four maps. The first could represent the distribution graphic which is relatively unchanged over recent decades. The next could represent data that has changed - or alternatively the first map could incorporate this. A second/third map could represent data that is subject to change as information comes in. Or since such information doesn't come in that fast, could be a more detailed 'blow-up' map showing variation within relevant geographic areas. Lastly, and only if practical, a map containing the overall graphics could be devised. Resolution in such a map would likely be relatively poor, but would provide instant conceptual information, which could be pursued in a more detailed map.    <LF>   :Of course as you say, map creation is no simple task, let alone creation of a map to portray data that on closer inspection gets quite messy. Still, just a thought. Of course for any distribution map to be created, data needs first to be tabulated, so tables per this article are also indispensible. But a good graphic, derived from such tabulated data, is almost unbeatable for maximal conceptual transmission in the shortest time. A more simple solution than the time-consuming and possibly redundant exercise I've suggested above, is to create a 'map revision' date, whereby an existing map is revised to portray most recently available data. Here one might have two maps: an 'in-use' map, and an 'under-revision' map. The maps are then interchanged at the prescribed interval. The maps would need to be notated so readers are clear. The 'in-use' map would need to clearly state that it will prevail until the next revision at date X, at which time the 'under-revision' map will be swapped. This should allay concerns of any readers/editors who spot inaccuracies or outdated data. They could be invited to provide the information they are aware of to the 'under-revision' map project. Anyone who has worked in organisations which have to continually revise policies and procedures while still functioning day-to-day will recognise this heuristic immediately. Anyway, just food for thought. By the way, a further brief search gave me the map in [http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/29/4/513.full#xref-ref-20-1 this 2001 articl

Overall, it looks like written by some advocator of milk consumption who wants to persuade you that lactose intolerance is actually no problem at all, and that by not consuming milk you undergo the risk of several nutritional deficiencies. Some statements are simply absurd; one part basically says that &quot;milk is fortified in some countries, therefore in these countries, if you do not consume milk, you have to find other sources, otherwise you will be deficient&quot;.

For example, what does the lines dividing South America or Spain in half even mean? The data itself is also very dubious. The populations of Argentina and Uruguay for instance are around 90% of European origin.

(For many decades and perhaps longer, a common medical myth believed even by many physicians was that if one burned one's fingers, a good remedy was to smear butter on the burn.  It turns out there is no truth to this.  So, in cases where the medical community has failed to grasp some truth, there is no reason in the world that the same myth should be believed '''or disseminated''' by anyone else.   <LF>   We have a huge responsibility when writing for Wikipedia to adhere to what is actually true and not perpetuate falsehoods.  At one point I noticed a falsehood was being perpetuated on Wikipedia and wondered why.  The references that were used for this claim in this article, as well as hundreds more websites that repeated the myth . . . all traced back to that Wikipedia article in the first place.  We live in a big echo chamber.

There was no communist involvement.  It was a legitimate uprising against brutalities committed by the Korean government against their own people.  I actually LIVED IN GWANGJU in May of 1980.  Granted, I was a bit young at the time, but I and my family are not &quot;communist sympathisers&quot;  My father and mother were Baptist missionaries to South Korea at the time.  It is an absolute insult to the brave people of Gwangju to imply communist involvement in the Uprising.  Even the current South Korean government has stated that the 5.18 was a result of military atrocities.  The only real debate about the Gwangju Uprising is related to the number of people who died.  THERE IS NO DEBATE ABOUT COMMUNIST INVOLVEMENT.  THERE WAS NONE.  24.180.28.245 should be blocked from any further edits.

Conversley, historians and religion scholars have reached consensus that Jesus, as described in the New Testament, was not actually born in 1 BCE.

'''This was introduced about the year 527 by Dionysius Exiguus, a Scythian monk resident at Rome, who fixed its starting point in the year 753 from the foundation of Rome, in which year, according to his calculation, the birth of Christ occurred.''' Making this the year 1 of his era, he counted the years which followed in regular course from it, calling them years &quot;of the Lord&quot;, and we now designate such a date A.D. (i.e. Anno Domini). The year preceding A.D. 1 is called Ante Christum (A.C.) or Before Christ (B.C.). It is to be noted that there is no year O intervening, as some have imagined, between B.C. and A.D. It is supposed by many that the calculation of Dionysius was incorrect, and that the birth of Christ really occurred three years earlier than he placed it, or in the year of Rome 753 which he styles 3 B.C. This, however, is immaterial for the purposes of chronology, the first year of the Christian Era being that fixed, rightly or wrongly, by Dionysius. His system was adopted but gradually, first in Italy, then in other parts of Christendom. England would appear to have been among the earliest regions to have made use of it, under the influence of the Roman missioners, as it is found in Saxon charters of the seventh century. In Gaul it made its appearance only in the eighth, and its use did not become general in Europe until after A.D. 1000; accordingly in French the term millÃ©sime was frequently used to signify a date A.D. In Spain, although not unknown as early as the seventh century, the use of the Christian Era, as will presently be shown, did not become general until after the middle of the fourteenth century.    <LF>   -from the Catholic Encyclopedia (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03738a.htm#christia

Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD 1 and 1 BC. Most have selected 1 BC (historians do not use a year zero). '''Because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years &quot;since the Incarnation&quot; implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1 BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1 BC.'''

Our article currently uses the 22,000: '':about 6000 POWs from the Ostashkov camp, about 4,000 POWs from the Starobielsk camp, about 4500 POWs from the Kozielsk camp, and about 7000 prisoners in Western parts of Belarus and Ukraine.&quot;'' Now Zawodny gives the same numbers for camps (actually, somewhat more specific - see my recent additions), and that totals around 15,000. But what source gives that '7000 prisoners in Western parts of Belarus and Ukraine'?

The problem is that there were also a lot of Poles imprisoned in minor camps and prisons in &quot;Western Belarus&quot; and &quot;Western Ukraine&quot;. A large number of officers were last seen there and are still missing and presumably killed in the same massacre. The &quot;Ukrainian trace&quot; is mentioned also in several Russian documents, though still little is known. For instance there is a Beria's order of March 22 to transfer ca. 3000 Polish prisoners from prisons in LwÃ³w, RÃ³wne, Tarnopol, StanisÅ‚awÃ³w and Drohobycz to prisons in Kiev, Kharkov and Kherson, while additional 3000 were to be transferred from BrzeÅ›Ä‡, Wilejka, PiÅ„sk and Baranowicze to Minsk. It is often assumed that these could have been murdered in [[Kuropaty]] near Minsk and [[Bykovnia]] near Kiev. There is archaeological evidence that some Poles were indeed murdered there, but after 60 years little is certain. The Russians have provided the list of names of those transfered to Ukrainian prisons to the Polish historians, but all other documents are lacking, including the analogical list of people sent to Minsk. You can read more on that [http://www.wspolnota-polska.org.pl/index.php?id=ak50322_1 here], in an article by one of IPN historians - sadly in Polish only.   <LF>   ::As to the source for both numbers - it is the infamous Politburo P13/144 document ([http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_resolution.html] for instance), where the case of &quot;14,700 POWS held in the camps - former Polish Army officers, government officials, landowners, policemen, intelligence agents, military policemen, settlers and jailers&quot; is treated together with the case of &quot;arrested and remaining in prisons in the western districts of Ukraine and Byelorussia people in the number of 11 000 - members of various counter-revolutionary spy and sabotage organizations, former landowners, factory owners, former Polish Army officers, government officials and fugitives&quot;. Later the group bound for extermination was limited to 18,632 people, and we do not know for sure how many people were in fact murdered following the order of March 5th.

Stalin committed so many violent purges of his own people that, when Hitler's armies suddenly attacked Stalin in 1941, there were scarcely any Russian generals left to resist him. If the Nazi's had not been as bad as Stalin and would not have murdered &quot;inferior&quot; Slavic peasants and Jewish peoples during their attack, the captive peoples of Russia might have risen up against the Soviets and successfully overthrown Stalin instead.  Why are you pro-Soviet apologists quibbling over the number of victims in the Katyn Forest Massacre? Stalin was a murdering, paranoid fanatic and a sociopath. It's a wonder there is anyone left in Russia alive. He didn't just have twenty thousand people from Poland executed. Stalin murdered millions of people! He had over five million people starved to death in the Ukraine alone! When did the Soviet army ever overrun any territory and there was not a massacre of innocent civilians afterward? Did any country or people ever say to the Soviets, &quot;Hey. We don't know how to run our country. Please come in and show us how to do it&quot;? Exactly. The very purpose of Soviet plans for world domination is to liquidate the intelligentsia (those who know how to run things, like the victims murdered and dumped at Katyn) after conquering the territory, in order to eliminate the very idea of any other system other than communism. -Ned. (Sept.)   <LF>   Maybe the Soviets should set up a program about world hunger: &quot;How to have all your crops fail for seventy-five years in a row.&quot;    <LF>   My above point is this: the Katyn Forest Massacre didn't happen within a historic vacuum. After the Bolshevik Revolution, which was violent, the Soviets first massacred the people around Moscow who were related in any way to Czarist Russia. Then the Soviets massacred the people in the nearer provinces whom they thought might resist. Then the Soviets eliminated the people in the outer provinces who didn't like what they were doing. It was systematic. It took the Soviets decades to consolidate their power in Russia (while the West stood by). It is standard procedure for Communists to eliminate the enemies of their revolution. Within this context of historical methodology (no matter how violent or murderous it is), the Katyn Massacre should not really surprise anybody. It is what the Communists always do.-Ned.

The soviets, especially through Stalin, did murder millions of people indeed, of their own too. They also displaced large populations and re-colonized annexed territories to the point of identity loss for some smaller countries. The tragedy and scale of all that is hard to grasp from the relative comfort of the west. The interesting point though is how, according to the reporting from this year's May 9th celebrations for instance, Stalin is still favorably viewed by many russians and even their official position on the matter seemed somewhat ambiguous.

I think it's a difficult question, and certainly not one I'm qualified to grapple with. But I can come up with a few thoughts about it. Clearly, in the West, Soviet guilt is pretty much unquestioned in mainstream history. When you come at it that way it looks like a question of the notability of the view, not the accuracy of the view&amp;mdash;is the view of Nazi guilt notable enough to warrant this balanced treatment, and if so to what degree? But on the other hand, what is the view in, say, Russia? How do the competing views compare in terms of notability there? I'm ''guessing''&amp;mdash;I don't know this&amp;mdash;that the view of Nazi guilt is probably a good bit common there, perhaps mainstream and in practical competition with the view of Soviet guilt. So I think it's a complex question that requires a lot of consideratio

My history prof introduced the issue neutrally. Simply put, when the site of the massacre was discovered, the Nazis blamed the Soviets and the Soviets blamed the Nazis. People today are too quick to jump to the conclusion that the Soviets are responsible for the killings just because the Nazis discovered the site. The Nazis may be responsible for the massacre: they were certainly masters of propaganda. If they are in fact responsible, the issue parallels the Reichstag fire in 1933. I'm not saying they are responsible, I'm simply pointing out that we can't justify either POV 100%. I believe that the article should be represented more neutrally than has been done. -Mar

The kind of ambivalent view that you are proposing might have been justified, if only just barely, before 1989.  However, since then the Soviet Union and then Russia have admitted that the Soviets carried out the massacre, have produced the original documents in which the order was given by Stalin's politburo, and exhumed additional mass graves in places which the German army never reached, removing any possibility that the dead in those mass graves were killed by the Germans.  In short, after those revelations there is no longer the slightest doubt among serious historians as to who carried out the massacre.

Wikipedia is free for everyone to edit, and every reasonable point of view should be mentioned therein.

It seemed to me fairly certain that any attempt to compare the Holocaust with other killings should be considered offensive per se, as it results in belittling of the Holocaust's unique tragedy. No I see that there are people, at least in Poland, who are eager to compare the execution of several thousand officers with a wide-scale annihilation of the nation, including children, women, civilians. As awful as it is, such executions as the former were a fairly common thing under Stalin's criminal regime. If it was NKVD who perpetrated the crime, I don't see why Katyn should be distiniguished from similar and even more ghastly executions carried on by the same organization. We should keep in mind that the officers executed there were the same that prepared the projected Polish invasion of the Soviet Union in 1939. They were not angels, to say the least. Polish historians forget to mention that thousnads of Soviet POWs died from hunger in Pilsudski's concentration camps after they had been taken captive during the Polish-Soviet War. So I can't compare Katyn with Holocaust, sorry. I hope that Balcer will apologize for his inept and disgusting comment.

Moreover, some countries had multiple competing self-proclaimed governments (France, Poland, the Baltics) throughout the war, which makes things even more complicated.

(Source - &quot;Katyn's syndrome in Soviet-Polish relations&quot; by JaÅ¾borovskaja and others &lt;In Russian&gt;). Of course they published in 1943 some selected document in the book for propaganda purpose. Another interesting question is why his name is absent in the list. I read that list of names has strange lacunas - like after #17 goes #23 and so on. Apparently he was removed from the list like many others.

Although little can be seen on the scan, it must've been issued before the war and not during it. First of all, it's a ''certificate of Polish citizenship''. I can hardly imagine the Nazi authorities who conquered Poland and tried to erase her name from all maps issued anything but a ''Certificate of General Government's citizenship''. Secondly, it's written in Polish and not in German, unlike all war-time documents of both civil and military administration of the General Government. Third thing is the address that could be identified as ''Miodowa'' street. During the German occupation the street was renamed after some Nazi bonzo, I don't remember which one but could check it. Then, the date of issue (and the number of the document) is hardly visible in the top left, but with 90% certainity it's 1/7/1938- which would suggest [[July 1]], [[1938]].

2298	2295	232	229	1	461730	13382367	2295	-1	-1	-1	0	-1	0	-1	I was aware of the fact that it is the Polish spelling. I am also aware that practically every school child in Poland knows about Katyn. But this is not the issue. The issue is strictly a linguistic one. The Polish transpription of KÐ°Ñ‚Ñ‹Ð½ÑŒ into KatyÅ„ is absolutely perfect, because it expresses the soft sign 'ÑŒ' at the end of the Russian word. The Polish transcription is more appropriate than the English one. However, this article is an English one. The English language/alphabet simply does not provide any soft sign. Therefore it has to be omitted in the English transcription. It is only confusing for an English reader to be confronted with an 'Å„'. You would not accept any English transcriptions in an Polish Wikipedia article either. For example 'ÐœÐ¾ÑÐºÐ²Ð°' to 'Moscow', instead of 'Moskwa', or 'Ð¡Ð¸Ð±Ð¸Ñ€ÑŒ' to 'Siberia' instead of 'Syberia'. So why do you impose the Polish transcription on an English article? Once again it is a minor point, but the Wikipedians strive to be as accurate as possible in their articles, and this transcription is simply not correct. So, do or don't do what you please, but be aware it is a mistake.   <LF>   By the way my mother tongue is not English (nor Russian, nor Polish). So, you cannot claim that my point of view is a nationalistic one.   <LF>

I immediately contacted the Fuehrer, who gave me permission to send a telegram to the International Red Cross, requesting it to collaborate to the greatest extenet possible in identifying corpses.

At the same time, however, the Polish Government, on behalf of the Polish Nation, deny to the Germans any right to base on a crime they ascribe to others, arguments in their own defence.

Anders at page 160 quotes the Russian comunicate of April 15 and then on the following page he states that ''The Soviet government assumed that the Polish plea to the International Red Cross was enough to break diplomatical relations with Poland'' (my translation). He then continues that ''in the note of April 25, the Soviet government accused Polish government of collaboration with Hitler in that propaganda campaign related to the finding of graves of the Polish officers near Smolensk. The note said that &quot;All these circumstances force the Soviet government to announce that the current government of Poland, by entering a path of collaboration with Hitler's government, ceased to continue allied relations with the Soviet Union and became its enemy.

No foreign personnel, including the Polish communists, were allowed to join the Burdenko Commission.[1] [3] This forms a sharp contrast with the German investigation, which allowed wider access to both international press and organizations (like the Red Cross) and even used Polish workers, like JÃ³zef Mackiewicz[24].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   '''Thatâ€™s factually inaccurate and not neutral. '''   <LF>   Soviets did allow access to international press and others (one of them â€“ daughter of American ambassador). Also Polish Corps buried remains after exhumation works were finished.   <LF>   The comparison between the German and the Soviet investigations is not neutral. On the other hand it could be said that Germans made public propaganda campaign out of the investigation while the Soviet commission concentrated on the practice work having to investigate much more pits and graves with killed Soviet citizens all over Soviet Union. For example in Smolensk area they also found 87 mass graves with 135,000 killed Soviet citizens and POWs. And unlike forensic experts in the pro-German commission who cannot date the murder from bodiesâ€™ state and had to rely on the found documents with dates, Soviet specialists were much more experienced.

He mentioned that they found that Polish officeres were to set to OSO of the NKVD and their cases should be investigated by this extrajudicial body. And at the end he called Gorbachev to arrive at a

And thus it was influenced by such admittion and the case became politically motivated. In USSR it was as a direct order in what direction should the case be investigated.   <LF>   But they had a trouble very soon â€“ they found that OSO couldnâ€™t send Poles to death because it had no such rights. The most hard punishment OSO could gave was 8 years of corrective labor with prohibition of correspondence. So, in 1992 the version changed a bit â€“ they â€œdiscoveredâ€ sealed package no.1 and among them the Politburo shooting order were Politburo set up special troika that sentenced Poles to death.

At that time in 1992  in the Consitution Court of Russia there was the trial over the banned Communist Party of the SU. And during this process the President side out of sudden showed the copies of the documents from the package no.1 that was just found. When defendants demanded a criminal expertise of the originals the President side refused to give them and in the final Court decision the Katyn case was not mentioned.    <LF>   And what is suspicious here is that they didnâ€™t allow seeing originals for more than 10 years (while the criminal case #159 was in process). Considering that the most effective technical expertise on falsification could be done for document during the first 5 year it invites some questions.

While conducting research on Katyn at the Archives in spring 1990, a Polish-American art and antiques expert named Waclaw Godziemba-Maliszewski was given a copy of an article entitled &quot;The Katyn Enigma: New Evidence in a 40-Year Riddle&quot; that had appeared in the Spring 1981 issue of Studies in Intelligence. It was written by CIA officer and NPIC analyst Robert G. Poirier, who used imagery from Luftwaffe aerial photoreconnaissance during World War II to uncover evidence of the original crime and a Soviet coverup during 1943-1944. 16 The imagery, selected from 17 sorties flown between 1941 and 1944 and spanning a period before, during, and after the German occupation of the Smolensk area, was important evidence. Among other things, it showed that the area where the mass graves were located had not been altered during the German occupation and that the same area displayed physical changes that predated the Germans' arrival. It also captured the NKVD on film bulldozing some of the Polish graves and removing bodies. Poirier speculated that the corpses had been removed and reburied at another site.''   <LF>   ::''At the National Archives, Godziemba-Maliszewski located the same imagery that Poirier had used. He also found additional shots of Katyn and the other two execution sites at Mednoye and near Kharkov. He discovered much additional imagery, new collateral evidence, and eyewitness testimony, resulting in important new conclusions about what actually happened at Katyn.''   <LF>   ::''After completing further research, in January 1991 Godziemba-Maliszewski turned over copies of the imagery and Poirier's article to scientists at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. They in turn passed the information to the Polish Ministry of Justice. The Ministry had to be convinced that the article and photographic evidence were bona fide and that Godziemba-Maliszewski was not, as some suspected, a CIA agent! Stefan Sniezko, Poland's deputy general prosecutor, then gave an interview to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel [Daily Mirror], published on 12 May 1991. This was the first public disclosure of the Luftwaffe imagery and its utility for identifying burial sites in the USSR.''   <LF>

Resolving the reference [1] (which leads us to that CIA article), it reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Strictly speaking, even the Polish servicemen were not POWs. The USSR had not declared war, and the Polish commander in chief had ordered his troops not to engage Soviet forces.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/code&gt; That again contradicts to the numerous claims in the article that prisoners of war were killed.

Nonetheless as it is obvious that Poland was a participant of the war and an Ally in 1939, it is also obvious that Katyn massacre was carried on Allied personel during the time Allies were involved in the IIWW. I honestly don't see a problem here: 'rules laywers' may try to argue that SU was not a part of the war till 1941, but there is no denying Poland was. What's more is there to say?

The tag with the wording that this is &quot;one of the best articles produced by the WP community&quot; applied to the article with several clear questions about both neutrality and factual accuracy is harmful for the reputation of the FA tag as well as for WIkipedia as a whole. Once the issues are addressed, we can put it up for another FA vote if authors want that. It seems to me that the problems are so clear that no de-FA formal vote is necessary, especially since it is likely to rise same kinds of barbs and emotions that were present in the FAing vote.

I am not accusing Raul in taking sides here. I just suggest that FAing should be more a conservative process.

There was no apparent reason for the selection. Khatyn was one of 9,200 Belorussian villages the Germans had destroyed and one of more than a hundred where they had killed civilians in retaliation for partisan attacks. In Latin transliteration, however, Katyn and Khatyn look and sound alike, though they are spelled and pronounced quite differently in Russian and Belorussian. When President Nixon visited the USSR in July 1974, he toured the Khatyn memorial at his hosts' insistence. Sensing that the Soviets were exploiting the visit for propaganda purposes, The New York Times headlined its coverage of the tour: &quot;Nixon Sees Khatyn, a Soviet Memorial, Not Katyn Forest.&quot; (The Times probably got it right. During the Vietnam war, the Soviets frequently took visiting US peace activists to Khatyn.)   <LF>

Soviets released Polish soldiers below the rank of NCOs, but they kept officers (the ~8,000) and NCOs (which I think compromise the ~25,000), and that the 25,000 represents all non-officer soldiers of Polish nationality.

Although assuming minorities had no reservations about joining Polish army (conscripts, seems logical) almost 1/3 of them would be non-Poles (as about 1/3 of SPR population were minorities), however Ukrainians and Belarusians would compromise only 17% of the total population (see [[Second_Polish_Republic#Minorities]] for details). This 17% of gives us closer to ~42,500. Thus if NKVD released ~125,000 out of their ~250,000, plus about 42,500 soon afterwards, thus assume in the ~167,500 released that way we have ~125,000 non-B. and non-U., thus not only did the NKVD release some Poles but I'd say that it's unlikely half of them were B. and U. (unless my math is wrong...?), and thus saying that majority of the released were B. and U. seems doubtful. I have adjusted the article's text to reflect this, feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

Moving stuff to subarticle may be warranted when the stuff is redundant but not to simply shorten the article that seems &quot;too long&quot;. Perhaps the subject is worthy. For instance, Piotrus lately moved stuff out of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] despite my fierce protests and now the material is staying on the backburner with no one caring. Another problem with such material removal is that the duplication creates separate articles evolving on their own creating extra work for editors and possibility of intra-wikipedia contradictions. Example of an acceptable spin-off is when the article contains a redundant section arbitrary pasted into it while its content should be integrated by being rearranged among the properly structured sections. But I don't see a case for that here now. The flow is chronological: prelude, events, post-events development (also in chronological order). No need to create subarticles as of now.

While the president of the Russian Federation admitted that the massacre was done by the NKVD, he is not a COURT to decide, and, to my knowledge, it was not yet solved in COURT. Thus, despite the evidence implicating that the massacre is a work of NKVD, it has not yet been made final. Also, there are interesting problems. For example, the article states that the poles were shot in the back of the head. My sources indicate same thing - 98.5% of the dead were shot in the back of the head, the rest - in the back of the neck. However, the poles executed in Kharkov and Kalinin show a different pattern - 60% are shot in the neck, with the rest getting shot in the back of the head. What is the difference between the two ways of execution? When shot in the head, it doesn't nessesarily mean instant death, but is simpler to do, while shooting in the back of the neck requires twisting the hand with the gun in such a way so that the bullet severs the nerves, causing instant death. Oh, and did I mention that the poles in Kharkov and Kalinin are shot with russian weapons, while it's widely known that the &quot;NKVD&quot; somehow used german weapons in Katyn. Also, supposedly exhumations turned up newspapers. I suggest all of you who believe that it is possible, to go get some newspaper, wrap them in cloth and bury them for a year. It is not gonna be readable.   <LF>   Another thing - the documents this page gives as proof seem fake. I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but something is out of place in them. However, it is too early to say they are fake.   <LF>   So supposedly the documents show Soviet motivation (although it goes much against Soviet legal practice, and is much more befitting the Germans); so, could Germany have a motivation to blame Katyn on USSR? Certainly. Could the Polish government have a motive to blame Soviets over Germans? Certainly - after all, this government in exile was at war with the USSR, and it had to be justified to the Western Allies. Did the late government of the USSR have a motive to lie? Certainly - they were traitors/fools after all. To summarize - this is still quite a controversial topic. With respec

Do not forget, on corpses in Katyn have been found injuries made with soviet bayonets.   <LF>   I am not going to comment your theory concerning faking documents, I don't have any knowledge about how paper behaves in soil.   <LF>   When the graves were discovered Polish government was not in state of war wits USSR: see [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]]. Only when Poles had asked the Red Cross to investigate the case, Soviets accused Poles of supporting Nazis and created &quot;Polish communistic government&quot;. It was very beneficial for Soviets: they had a pretext to occupy Poland and incorporate it's eastern part into USSR.   <LF>   Finally, it has been solved in court: 1946 {{Nuremberg Trials}}: Soviets accused some Germans of Katyn, but the Germans were found innocent. So, if no Germans then who?   <LF>   I hope I've clarified the whole thing. Anyway, it was a strange experience: like explaining someone that the Nazi concentration camps were created by Nazis, not by Soviets.   <LF>

Seeing as their government has admitted that its own forces carried out this massacre, the only real debate is whether this qualifies as a genocide or not, and I believe that the article does touch on both sides of that debate. There is no way of sugarcoating an event like this, the systematic, high-level murder of 25,000 unarmed and defenceless people is a ghastly crime that is bound to provoke revulse, and though most rational thinking people will not associate the modern russian government with this crime, it is evidently still a very sensitive issue. Personally I think it should just be accepted as a genocide and let the world move on. When there is a wealth of evidence against Russia, an admittance of guilt, and very little apart from crazy conspiracy theories with no factual evidence about falsified papers, it is very hard to represent a pro russian view, personally I think the article is perfectly fair.

This is very misleading.   <LF>   First of all we must decide whether we care about all estimates or only about the credible ones. As an analogy, one can point to the Nazi camps Majdanek and Auschwitz. Many estimates were made throughout the decades, most of them clearly erroneous. Thus, for a long time an estimate of 4,000,000 victims in Auschwitz was rather widespread (especially through the Soviet-dominated Europe - but not exclusively). So it is for Majdanek, where there was an estimate of 1.5 million victims (contrast this with the current estimate of 78,000 victims). Then there are deniers' &quot;estimates&quot;...   <LF>   Thus, one could write something like &quot;estimates of the number of dead in Auschwitz range from 70,000 to 4,000,000&quot;, and that would be true in a sense that there are such estimates. But this would mislead the reader unnecessarily.   <LF>   Now, there is no controversy about the number of the victims of Katyn massacre (when the term is used in the extended fashion, to denote all the victims murdered according to the 5.3.1940 order). It is about 22,000, take or add a thousand.   <LF>   Now, when dilettantes write about the Katyn massacre, they often have in mind numbers like &quot;14,000&quot; or &quot;15,000&quot;. But those denote only the number of Polish victims from the three camps. They ignore about 7000 or so victims from the prisons. So one cannot really compare the numbers like 15,000 and 22,000, saying that they're just &quot;estimates&quot;. It's apples and oranges - 15,000 is for the victims from the three camps, 22,000 is for the victims from the three camps AND from an unknown number of prisons.   <LF>   So I will edit this portion accordingly.

I have the same question concerning titles containing the word massacre: Why [[Parsley Massacre]] but [[Rohingya massacre]]?  Perhaps if such topics are considered events and as such are considered proper nouns...but I'd like to see all such titles conform across the board, to a coherently stated convention, whichever convention is supported by either clear policy or robust consensus.  I haven't looked hard for it at all, but maybe someone else has: Is there any established WP policy, guideline, or village pump decision on precisely this?&quot;   <LF>

In the titles it is a name of an event (&quot;Greek Genocide&quot;), a term and not word-combination (adjective + noun) to mark the belonging of the event. The same way the terms for [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] or [[Caribbean Crisis]] and not [[Caribbean crisis]] with Caribbean as an adjective and crisis as a noun. Or the [[Berlin Blockade]], for another example.&quot;   <LF>   :to which I queried further:   <LF>   *&quot;Is your vision... supported by a WP policy, and if so, please point me to that policy.  I studied [[WP:Article titles]] and [[WP:Naming conventions#Capitalization]] to no avail.  Where is this 'an event, or series of events, is a proper noun whose terms shall be capitalized' policy, if there is one?  Declaring that something is an Event (not to opine in any way that this E/event isn't one) and thus is a proper noun that should be capitalized, could be controversial to some, and might encompass different scopes for different folks, so please explain also, if you can, why (as examples--there are a vast number of 'E/events' that might have this issue) the E/events currently titled (and capitalized like this--&gt;) [[Greek genocide]], [[Dersim genocide]], [[Burundi genocide]], and [[Rohingya massacre]] should not be capitalized as you propose for the move to [[Armenian Genocide denial]], if there is a good reason to handle each differently. Staying arbitrarily within the narrow category of death and dying-themed events only, why [[Moors murders]] and [[Soham murders]], but [[Parker-Hulme Murder]]?  (the current examples suggest, somewhat irregularly, that single death is an Event, but multiple death is an event, unless it's a whole lot of death, in which case it's an Event??)  What is the WP policy, if there is one, that sets these sorts of boundaries (or not) for E/events of all flavors?&quot;   <LF>   :and got this answer:   <LF>   *&quot;I do think that massacres or genocides you noted above should be capitallised. Those are events. A murder is an event, a pogrom is an event, a mass murder (massacre) is an event, a genocide is an event, but an article &quot;Mass murders&quot; is not an event, an article &quot;The genocides of Europe&quot; is not AN event or [[Sexual disorder]] is a collective word-combination and a collective article but [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder]] is a name of one disorder. the same way [[Greek Genocide|Greek]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] or Armenian Genocides are separate events and not some variety of genocides or something. I don't even thing this was ever discussed. Just all the [[WP:RS]]s write it with a capital letter so no doubts.&quot;   <LF>   :Please share your thoughts on the idea of changing the name of this page to Katyn Massacre, a proper noun.  I'm going to try to edit the Manual of Style to address this question, and before I do, I'd like to find out what community consensus is on the matter.   <LF>   :Sorry so long-winded.

The basic idea here is to separate the big 1990-2004 investigation with all its fact-finding work, from the subsequent action that focused on the post-1990 events instead of the 1940 ones. I made the header plural because I assume the INR's actions also count (as soon as someone actually writes what they did on Katyn). The Russian article's relevant header is &quot;Investigation by the Prosecutor-General's Office of the USSR and Russia&quot;, but that's kinda long, no?

It '''does not in any way attempt to argue with the official view''' on the subject, just points that there is a different point of view among certain circles. The two sentences (literally - two!)

While it's clearly stated that talk pages are ''not a forum for general discussion of the article's subject'', they are absolutely for discussing the article (while of course being [[Wikipedia:Civility|polite]] and [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers|welcoming]]!), which would include &quot;debating&quot; content if it was unclear, disputed, etc. Maybe [[Special:Contributions/69.125.134.86|69.125.134.86]] felt unsure of himself and so compelled to issue that disclaimer. Anyway, I think it's clear at this point what the motivation of the Soviets was, based on this excerpt from the article:   <LF>   ''The reason for the massacre, according to historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]], was that Stalin wanted to deprive a potential future Polish military of a large portion of its talent:''&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;...[the massacre] should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border. Since he intended to keep the eastern portion of the country in any case, Stalin could be certain that any revived Poland would be unfriendly. Under those circumstances, depriving it of a large proportion of its military and technical elite would make it weaker&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   ''In addition, Soviets realized that the prisoners constituted a large body of trained and motivated Poles who would not accept a [[Fourth Partition of Poland]].''   <LF>   At least it seems clear to me.

That sentence now reads, &quot;In private, Churchill agreed that the atrocity was likely carried out by the Soviets. According to Edward RaczyÅ„ski, Churchill admitted on April 15, 1943, during a conversation with General Sikorski: 'Alas, the German revelations are probably true. The Bolsheviks can be very cruel'&quot;.[58]  The citation is to the Carlton book at page 105, which I do not have.  What I do have is a copy of Edward Raczynski's war diaries, titled &quot;In Allied London&quot; and published in English in 1962.  In that book, on page 141, Raczynski discusses the lunch he had with Churchill, Sikorski and Cadogan on April 15, 1943.  He says that they discussed the dispute between Russia and Poland over frontiers, then says, &quot;This conversation took place a day or two after the announcement in Berlin of the discovery of the graves at Katyn.  We told him that we had concrete proof of the responsibility of the Soviet Commissariat of Internal Affairs.  Churchill, without commenting himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it.  He remarked: 'The Bolsheviks can be very cruel.' He added, however, that their ruthlessness was a source of strength, and was to our advantage as far as destroying Germans was concerned.&quot;  There is nothing further regarding this lunch.  Given that Churchill appears to have intentionally avoided any explicit agreement with the proposition that the Russians were to blame, it seems an overstatement to say that Churchill &quot;admitted&quot; that &quot;the Germans revelations are probably true.&quot;  Does anyone have the Carlton book?  Perhaps he cites some other source authored by Raczynski.  If he cites &quot;In Allied London&quot; then I propose that the sentence be changed.   <LF>   It's been a couple weeks and there's been no objection, so I went ahead and changed the sentence, and the citatio

3009	3008	9	8	2	341404	341404	3008	-1	-1	-1	0	-1	0	-1	The matter of Cities in South Africa is generally done badly and the slant taken is normally a politically motivated thing. Subsequently I think it makes more sense to distinguish between &quot;Cities in South Africa&quot; and the Municipalities. Subsequently names such as Nelson Mandela Metropolitan should not appear in a list of cities but rather in a list of Municipalities. I am currently constructing an article on [South African Municipalities]. It is probably a good idea to include the name of the municipality serving each city in any list.   <LF>   This page does not give any accurate understanding of what is infact happening, which is as follows:   <LF>   *In 2000, the Municipal Demarcation Board which determined the boundaries of the new municipalities announced that the South African municipalities were reduced to 284 municipalities which have in turn been divided into 6 metropolitan municipalities, 47 district municipalities and 231 local municipalities (http://sagns.dac.gov.za/)   <LF>   *These replace over 1300 municipal structures   <LF>   *Places still retain there old name unless changed, this is especially true with regard to post   <LF>   *The position that the former entities remain towns and cities is suggested by several government documents etc ... including this comment:   <LF>

(http://sagns.dac.gov.za)   <LF>   My suggestion would therefore be to compose a list looking something like this:   <LF>   Cape Town (Cape Town Unicity Metropolitan Council)   <LF>   Port Elizabeth (Nelson Mandela Metropole)   <LF>   East London (Buffalo City)   <LF>   Durban (Ethekwini)   <LF>   Pietermaritzburg (Msunduzi)   <LF>   Bloemfontein (Mangaung)   <LF>   Johannesburg (Joburg Metropolitan Council)   <LF>   Pretoria (Tshwane)   <LF>   With all of the cities listed. Several Municipalities will be double listed (for example Buffalo City would be listed for both Bisho and East London)   <LF>   Furthermore &quot;There are officially nine cities in South Africa (members of the South African cities network). These are:&quot; is bluntly misleading and should be changed. The South African cities network is a non-governmental organisation and has no authority on the matter. Unfortunately at this time nobody does but that is a seperate issue.   <LF>   This would create a situation where a person would look up Port Elizabeth and find in the article a line stating that it forms part of and is served by the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Council. In an article on the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan a list of towns/cities etc in the Municipality will be listed and Port Elizabeth will be given as the seat.   <LF>   Im not going to change this page until there is some form of consensus on the matter.   <LF>

How would one mathematician read the formula over the phone to another mathematician, perhaps a stranger, using best practice terminology, is what I'm after. For example, I'm having difficulty in trying to apply the &quot;sum over ... from ... to ... of&quot; given with the sigma/summation definition in the table to a very fancy-looking pair of formulae that place the symbol in different places, one covering an entire fraction, the other covering only the numerator part of a fraction.    <LF>   Eamon   <LF>

Apart from the drawback you mentioned, the use of graphics is more complicated than the use of character entities.  This reduces the ease of use which is a basic idea of Wikipedia.  Another drawback is that in the mid-future all browser will display these characters and the re-substitution will be a lot of work.  A better idea would be to suggest a software feature that translates the entities into graphics if the user sets their preferences so.  In this way, proper character sizes could be chosen.

When I try to print this page I get muddled tables - pages break in the middle of cells, the top left edge of cells which occur at the top of a page is left out, some symbols don't show up.Is it possible (using CSS or some other method)to tell the printer that certain things (like table cells) are inviolable?  Then you could set something up such that the whole table gets broken up into smaller tables (depending on where the end of a given page is, which I presume is variable across different platforms/setups) and the rule would be: divide table cells so that only the line between two large cells (i.e. the cells which contain the symbols, and which correspond to individual entries) may be interpreted as a breakable point in the table. With CSS I would think you could get the table to construct itself dynamically that way, assuming that CSS knows anything about or can account for the behavior of printers. As for some symbols not showing up in printing, I can't fathom why, it shows up fine in my browser, and the omitted symbols are not limited to symbols which occur at page breaks. Also, it only seems to affect the large symbols at the beginnings of each entry, so if anyone thinks they have an idea what this kind of problem sounds like, please fix.  Note for testing purposes, I'm using Mozilla firefox. Things may (possibly) behave differently with different browsers.

However, Euler's number, which is written using the letter &quot;e&quot; is a constant-- this is kind of a poor distinction, but it avoids having to put rather pointless descriptions for the numerals 1-9, which are symbols.  With constant values.  I think the worry lies in whether common variable names should go in there, too, because (using phi as an example) phi is commonly used as either an angle or as a pseudo-ratio (how precise is phi?). I think there should be a completely seperate table altogether for those, but linked obviously to this one, so the wikireader will think &quot;oh, wait, maybe I'm looking for a CONSTANT &lt;nowiki&gt;(/variable),&lt;/nowiki&gt; not a SYMBOL...&quot;  I'm also complaining quietly that we SHOULD have pictures (.png, .svg, whatever) because a lot of these are not in the &quot;basic Unicode set&quot; or whatever it's called, and (IMHO) unicode is so wierdly organized that it should be avoided (i.e. everything is scattered, e.g. the accented &quot;e&quot;'s are seperated (grave/otherwise)).  Eh be sure to tell me if I'm being mean to unicode, though... I might be a little too critical, because I'm thinking that someday the unicode characters will be reordered and then replacing those numbers WILL be hard-- I've concluded that replacing pictures with their respective unicodes is probably an easier transition than making everybody download special character sets or using TeX (though TeX is kinda pretty and is a neat idea as far as I understand it

The formula '1+1=2' does not mean that 2 and 1+1 represent the same thing - it means that 2 and 1+1 ARE the same thing. The number two, after all, is not a symbol, and does not represent anything. Perhaps the writer intended ' 'x=y' means that 'x' and 'y' represent the same thing or quantity'. However, this is wrong too, for it fails to apply when 'x' and 'y' are being used as variables rather than proper names. I suggest: ' 'x=y' means that x and y are one and the same thing or quantity'.   <LF>

It's true that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are being used as variables in the two universal quantifiers at the beginning of the statement, but the statement would be meaningless if it did not imply the assignment of a specific value to the two variables in the conditional to which the quantifiers apply.  When we say (If x=y then y=x), we are saying if effect, &quot;Find the referent of &quot;x&quot;.  Do you have it?  Good.  Now find the referent of &quot;y&quot;. OK, now that you have two individual, specific, constant(non-variable), very concrete real-world values in mind, tell me if the first is equal to the second.  It is?  Then according to this statement of identity, I can conclude that the second value is equal to the first as well.&quot;   The purpose of a universally quantified statement is to say something general which can be applied to all possible SPECIFIC cases.

My view (which is probably in the minority) is that logic is not simply a word game or a self-consistent system of rules for the manipulation of symbols.  Logic is a tool which allows real human beings to communicate in a more precise way about the real world in which they really live.  Therefore, every term, variable, string, and symbol refers to something that really exists, or else it's meaningless.

These two symbols represent two very different ideas. &lt; and &gt; mean strictly less than or greater than, something purely algorithmic. A computer can analyse two numbers and determine if one is greater than the other. On the other hand, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are &quot;informal&quot; symbols, they don't have a strict mathematical meaning. The property of ''x'' being ''much greater'' than ''y'' is a matter of opinion and has no algorithmic equivalent. I'm not denying that &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are useful symbols, they are used often in applied mathematics, but i feel that they should be put in their own section rather than with &lt; and &gt;. I mean, â‰¤ and â‰¥ have their own section, and they are way closer in meaning to &lt; and &gt; than &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;.    <LF>   By the way, after a bit of thought, the only place where I can think &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; can be used algorithmically is if they are used to denote &quot;much less/greater than&quot; in transfinite set theory, as in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 \ll \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, but I have never seen it used that way so I highly doubt it. So dont mention it in the article because its just my idea ;).

It is not a proper symbol for multiplication.  Yes, we understand what is meant when we are in a calculator or computer context, but is is not correct mathematical grammar.  It is a bastardization introduced by calculators and then computers due to special limitations of calculator displays and input in come computer languages.  It only exist on a number pad because computer types who designed the number pads did not know any better. It is only that way in Excel because the designers of the program wanted to provide a quicker way to type in a multiplication from the keyboard than having to go find how to do a superscript over and over.  It is similar to the ^ being used for raising to a power.  3^2 is not a proper way to write 3 squared.  And 3E2 or 3EE2 are not proper mathematical grammar either.  These were all bastardizations made back when calculator displays were primitive and the pixie-tubes and seven-segment displays could not display the proper symbols. Sure when we see it we know what it is; but we should not write it.  Similar to when we hear aint, we know what the person means; but we still should not say or write it ourselves.  At least but it at the bottom of the list with a note not to use it in formal maths.

The later, which could be made from what we already have, as I suggested, would be useful if one did not know what subject to look under. Sometimes one encounters in an article on one subject an unfamiliar symbol from a different subject. (What motivated me was the symbol E in the article on the [[Traveling salesman problem]]. I guessed it might be expected value, but I had to scroll to the very end of this article to confirm that.) For a [[List of mathematical symbols by subject]] article, it would be fairly easy to translate Quartl's very nice [[:de:Liste mathematischer Symbole]] into English. The hard TeX and table stuff would not have to change at all. But I wonder if there are any MediaWiki or external tools that could make this a multilingual page?

Organization by subject makes sense if the user knows the proper name of the subject in which the symbol appears. Some symbols are not tied to a specific subject, such as âˆ‘, so how does a user know that they can find it in just about any subject? I think that any organization is going to need to have a great deal of redundancy (or at least internal links). I support the idea of having a short list of the more common symbols followed by subject specific symbols arranged by subject. Organization within these groupings is going to be problematic no matter how it is done if the sections have any length to them.

My thought with unsymmetric relations was that many symbols visually point to the right or left, e.g. &gt; and &lt; but also set inclusion, logical inference, etc. I think they make a grouping that would be easy to search through. Similarly there are a number of variations on the equals sign, that form a natural grouping, and so on.

Technology, especially the Internet, has changed the opportunities available for authors looking to self-publish.  I broke the section titled &quot;printing and production quality&quot; into multiple sections.  The original section covered printing techniques at the beginning and ended with obstacles to self-publishers such as marketing and advertising.  So, I broke that off into a section entitled &quot;Obstacles&quot; and I pulled some of the printing and production quality section out and integrated it into the proper topic under &quot;Types of Self-Publishing,&quot; a breakdown of the various types of self-publishing, including &quot;True Self-Publishing,&quot; &quot;Print on Demand,&quot; and &quot;Subsidy Publishing&quot; and the previous entry of &quot;Vanity Publishing.&quot;     <LF>   I think this is a good start to looking deeper into what self-publishing means to people today, and all explores various types of self-publishing.

Perhaps a section on POD publishing is in order -- it has become more and more popular.  Some of the services that POD companies offer can be explored.  A section on the history of self-publishing, talking about some of the authors mentioned in the Self-Published Best Sellers section may also be worthwhile.   <LF>

This should be called out and discussed more clearly.   <LF>   &quot;Death of the Dream&quot;, for example, is published by a county historical society, iirc, that commissioned the writing and photography that it contains.  Inasmuch as that organization has published little else, this volume might best be considered self-published.  Yet, it was printed in considerable quantity and has printing, binding, and overall production values comparable to any other &quot;coffee table&quot; book.  Self-published; but not self-printed.   <LF>

All the costs are folded into the sales price of the books, which are printed on demand as they're ordered.   <LF>   Another thing, which has gone pretty much nowhere, is the point of sale book machine. The idea is to allow a bookstore to have a machine that produces books on demand, with a selection of paper and binding grades. If a buyer wants a cheap paperback to read once, she can get it without having to wait weeks or months for the more expensive hardcover to sell down its print run enough for the publisher to start on the softcover. At the same time, a book collector can get the utmost in acid-free heavy paper with a hardcover, from the same machine.   <LF>   The cost for the machine would be a large chunk of change, but a bookstore with one would save big by not having to keep hundreds or thousands of books in stock, and the worst thing that can happen too a book store, selling out of a popular book, would never happen.   <LF>

Aside from being poorly sourced (the Library of Congress effort referred to did not address publishing in general, but was only a guide to a limited range of forthcoming titles intended to be used by libraries in considering new acquisitions. Aside from self-published titles, it also excluded  certain textbooks, reissued books, mass market paperbacks (whether original or reprint), travel guides, electronic books, and other categories.   The presentation of the LOC activity in the article was highly opinionated, if not downright inaccurate, and failed to present the limited information it contained in a manner that met WP:NPOV requirements.  The only relevant information one could infer from the sources is that very few self-published books are acquired by libraries; assuming that inference to be accurate, it should be stated concisely and sourced appropriately, rather than harangued in multiple section

Another reason, but not mentioned, is the age at first publication. Publishers want authors to be very young, because the publicity campaign to turn the author into a marketable celebrity is costly; so they want to ensure that these costs yield over several decades, which is kind of impossible if the new author is over 50. So the age factor is huge.   <LF>   For authors who are not in the public eye for some reason, and who are older than 20 years, self-publishing is the only outlet. While figures are not available officially, some reports say more books are self-published than trad. published. Most self-publishing authors nowadays did not even bother with submissions prior to publishing. 95 % of books from trad. publishers get pulped anyway, which are those 95 % who cannot attract a review in the newspaper. It is important for the public to know that self-publishing is not a judgement on quality; it simply means that people over twenty, who are neither celebrities nor academics do not fit the requirements of the trad publishing industry. There are also more books written than there is space on the shop shelves.    <LF>   The industry has changed, books are seen as an extension to the movie industry, the music industry, sports, political argument, academia, the newspapers, and yellow press - or they must be young, so they can be marketed as the new sensation. Any book or author who is not in one of these slots, must stand on his/her own two fee

The publishing houses have more experience than the individual author and unless they insert too many clichÃ©s or shift the fundamentals this is more of a sideline issue which I don't believe drives many people to self-publishing. What has a lot more influence on a writer's/ a book's success is that the signature on the dotted line means giving up economic control.    <LF>   When a book is published by a publisher in one country, normally the country where the author resides, it could well never go further than being sold in that one country. 'Sister' companies of the publisher in other countries are independent entities, despite having the same name, who make their own decisions on what they release in their territory. Giving an Australian example: The print run is normally 2,500 to 3,000 books. Nearly all Australian authors would look to expand their market into the other English speaking countries, but if the catalogues of the overseas sister companies are 'full', then the trad-published Australian author is excluded from approaching other companies and is left with the low figures of the Australian market. Some books have truly international content and could so easily 'get stuck' in a small market in a small country. After several years the rights might fall back to the author, but by then he/she might have undertaken a career change to pay the bills.    <LF>   With self-publishing, the author reaches a global audience immediately, although of course the penetration of each market is not as good as it would be as part of a solid publicity campaign from a publishing house. Authors have to weigh up where their priorities lie, but the increasing success of self-publishing in all media plus book shop closures suggest that the balance is shifting. For self-publishers, book shop closures are actually a good thing as they break the market dominance of the publishing industry who has so little room for new writer

They act like a publisher - they may hire an editor or at least an editorial assistant, they may hire a book designer or graphic artist, they find a printer, they handle the marketing, etc...  They typical vanity press, on the other hand, is essentially a turnkey operation which provides most or all of the services, for a fee, that a commercial publisher provides when it is publishing a book for its own list.

Rather, the editorial set-up of the article needed improvement. I have tried to make the development section clearer, tried to improve the subdivision into sections, improve the section headings. Further, I introduced a section on the great Unesco rescue operation. If this article would be split, as the High Dam is nowadays by far the most important one, I would rather have the High Dam on the page for &quot;Aswan Dam&quot;, with a reference to a separate &quot;Aswan Low Dam&quot; page.

The designers of the Old Dam were pushing the state of the art as to what they could really do successfully, and this caused a more balanced understanding of a project's impacts on nature and natural processes.  The High Dam was far less concerned about that, they knew what could be done successfully, and were most concerned about the developmentally positive possibilities; the project impacts are also a classic study area later environmental changes, when that concern became more widely accepted.

I try hard to remain neutral on dam articles and although this one needs a lot of citations, it is one of the best representations on good dam vs. evil dam I have read. A cost-benefit ratio is given and a nice amount of data which gives due weight to both sides. The big benefits are detailed well. Some of the negative impacts are seemingly refuted or remedied in the same paragraph. The idea I got from reading the article is that this dam has had an enormous positive impact on the country but has several problems that need to be addressed or have been addressed.   <LF>   :What may draw concern is the table of contents which at first glance gives the impression that article is full of negative impacts. I combined two sub-sections but given the complexity of the dam's impacts, the other sections are due and in some cases in need of expansion. The Historical monuments sub-section could have a great deal more information about the rescue of the ancient sites. Regarding the paragraph on sediment accumulation in the reservoir, the dead storage &quot;fill[ing] up after 300â€“500 years&quot; doesn't seem to be too extravagant. A reservoir's entire storage filling with sediment within 100 years is. It would be nice to compare that figure with other dams. After all, most dams are constructed with a 'shelf life'. 500 or 900 years is pretty good in my opinion. Plenty of time for dredging.   <LF>   :I noticed someone failed the GA nomination.

In my view, much of the information contained in the sections that have been removed is valuable. In my view, editors should check whether the information is accurate before removing it, or preferably keep it and add a source. This is what I have done for one of the sections that has been removed (drainage). Tagging information as unsourced should be sufficient, and removing it goes too far.    <LF>   A substantial rewrite along the lines suggested above is a good idea, but the minor changes done so far have fallen short of that objective and have actually in my view - unintentionally - deteriorated the article. For example, the lead section of the &quot;Impacts&quot; section, previously entitled &quot;Benefits&quot;, only mentions benefits. This  actually could lead readers to conclude that there now is a positive bias.

Googling the phrase &quot;Sankarshana form of Vishnu&quot; only leads to this wiki and does not clearly explain things in an encyclopedic manner.

I was wondering if you could explain or point me to a place where it simply states the policy instead of the debate over it. Either way this seems like a troubling policy to implement for historical articles (it almost seemed like the debate was over figures and place names largely). As a linguist you that removing the devanagari AND the IAST from Sanskrit articles means that there is vital information missing from the page that the IPA does not provide. To be able to use any of these articles academically (which I do, studying for my masters in yoga studies and history) one needs to have the standards of Indic academia addressed. My text books use IAST exclusively and no IPA ever. If you were academically studying these topics, the IPA is useless to you, and only the IAST matters. That's the only reason there is an International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration that is nearly universal in Indic studies. I understand removing excessive modern indic translations with their thousand regional variations, but this is removing troves of important information about a static and dead language, and you're not even replacing it with the IPA first, so the next editor will have a harder time making a proper IPA transliteration. Very concerning. It feels like watching books bur

I'm a firm believer in an encyclopedia detailing ''facts'', and given the conflicting reports about whether there was a mix-up because of the two names, it seems that the facts have got rather lost in the media frenzy to apportion blame and tie up all loose ends in the few days before the story falls out of the news. I added the bit on the Data Protection Act interpretation because Humberside police have stated that publicly so that ''is'' a matter of recorded fact. The Blunkett inquiry should find whether there were any name mix-ups and whether they were significant so this article can evolve as the inquiry progresse

However the story about the alleged mixup is part of the ongoing story of the murders.

It's http://www.channel4.com/news/2003/12/week_3/17_huntley.html, the relevant part being &quot;We now understand that Humberside were using a computer system which automatically deleted old records. When they searched the computer under the names Ian Huntley and Ian Nixon, which he had also been known as, nothing came up. Anything which had come up would not have revealed the sexual nature of the offences.&quot; I take your point about the issue being part of the process, and I've no objection to you adding it into the article. I did think of trying to modify the name mix-up text myself rather than remove it; the problem is it's hard to do without making a big thing about a minor point and we have to remember that the ultimate purpose of WP articles is to convey information to readers who might know nothing about the topic. I wanted to add the fact that Huntley also used the name of ''Nixon'' because his mother had reverted to her maiden name after the break-up of her marriage to Huntley's father (rather than as any attempt to disguide his identity) but couldn't think of a way to work it into the text without digressing into another minor point which didn't add much to a reader's understanding. So I sacrificed that. It's back to what I described in my talk to you as &quot;my favourite activity of trying to make an article look as though it's not been designed by committee&quot;; we should strive to give the reader a coherent article giving all the salient facts on the subject without overwhelming them with a rag-bag of facts that wikipedians have added just because they happened to know them.

If you can justify thier importance outside the context of the murder and connection with Huntley then by all means then thay should have a seperate page. Take Bart Simpson he is world famous and yet is fictional so has his own page. These girls are known only in the UK and are generally not talked about frequently any more. This is why Bart Simpson who is fictional has his own page and these giurls are being considered for merging.

There is no mention of this in the Wikipedia article, but surely it is relevant to the section on the murders, as it shows that Huntley was not the only suspect in the investigation?  &lt;small&gt;â€”

Is Moors Murders a proper noun, and if so, shouldn't it be Soham Murders?    <LF>   Here's my sense of it, copied from over there at the RfM, [where the proposal (not mine, I had questions that led to you) was to move the page from [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide]] to [[Armenian Genocide denial]]]:   <LF>   This was my first question, because I thought, &quot;Well, this would conform better to the Manual of Style (which does not cover this specific point...YET):   <LF>   *&quot;However, should it not be [[Armenian genocide denial]], unless there is some legitimate reason why in this case genocide should be capitalized?  Further, why should not (for examples) the articles [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Assyrian Genocide]], [[Srebrenica Genocide]], [[Rwandan Genocide]] follow the same naming conventions as do [[Greek genocide]], [[Dersim genocide]], and [[Burundi genocide]]?  I have the same question concerning titles containing the word massacre: Why [[Parsley Massacre]] but [[Rohingya massacre]]?  Perhaps if such topics are considered events and as such are considered proper nouns...but I'd like to see all such titles conform across the board, to a coherently stated convention, whichever convention is supported by either clear policy or robust consensus.  I haven't looked hard for it at all, but maybe someone else has: Is there any established WP policy, guideline, or village pump decision on precisely this?&quot;   <LF>

In the titles it is a name of an event (&quot;Greek Genocide&quot;), a term and not word-combination (adjective + noun) to mark the belonging of the event. The same way the terms for [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] or [[Caribbean Crisis]] and not [[Caribbean crisis]] with Caribbean as an adjective and crisis as a noun. Or the [[Berlin Blockade]], for another example.&quot;   <LF>   :to which I queried further:   <LF>   *&quot;Is your vision... supported by a WP policy, and if so, please point me to that policy.  I studied [[WP:Article titles]] and [[WP:Naming conventions#Capitalization]] to no avail.  Where is this 'an event, or series of events, is a proper noun whose terms shall be capitalized' policy, if there is one?  Declaring that something is an Event (not to opine in any way that this E/event isn't one) and thus is a proper noun that should be capitalized, could be controversial to some, and might encompass different scopes for different folks, so please explain also, if you can, why (as examples--there are a vast number of 'E/events' that might have this issue) the E/events currently titled (and capitalized like this--&gt;) [[Greek genocide]], [[Dersim genocide]], [[Burundi genocide]], and [[Rohingya massacre]] should not be capitalized as you propose for the move to [[Armenian Genocide denial]], if there is a good reason to handle each differently. Staying arbitrarily within the narrow category of death and dying-themed events only, why [[Moors murders]] and [[Soham murders]], but [[Parker-Hulme Murder]]?  (the current examples suggest, somewhat irregularly, that single death is an Event, but multiple death is an event, unless it's a whole lot of death, in which case it's an Event??)  What is the WP policy, if there is one, that sets these sorts of boundaries (or not) for E/events of all flavors?&quot;   <LF>   :and got this answer:   <LF>   *&quot;I do think that massacres or genocides you noted above should be capitallised. Those are events. A murder is an event, a pogrom is an event, a mass murder (massacre) is an event, a genocide is an event, but an article &quot;Mass murders&quot; is not an event, an article &quot;The genocides of Europe&quot; is not AN event or [[Sexual disorder]] is a collective word-combination and a collective article but [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder]] is a name of one disorder. the same way [[Greek Genocide|Greek]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] or Armenian Genocides are separate events and not some variety of genocides or something. I don't even thing this was ever discussed. Just all the [[WP:RS]]s write it with a capital letter so no doubts.&quot;   <LF>   :Please share your thoughts on the idea of changing the name of this page to Soham Murders, a proper noun, recognizing the significance of the event.  Yes, I do get that the Soham Murders were event''s'', but so are all the events that comprise any given genocide or massacre.  I'm going to try to edit the Manual of Style to address this question, and before I do, I'd like to find out what community consensus is on the matter.   <LF>   :Sorry so long-winded.

What do you mean by ''principles''? In this -- just as any article -- we need above all to describe ''what something is''. Like with the Elon proposal, we need to provide the reader with some basic information as to how these initiatives plan to solve the problem -- this seems to such a truism that I am irritated by having to take the trouble to state it here. This basic, non-controversial information was in your first version, but for reasons completely beyond me you deleted it. We have already had this discussion with the Elon proposal. Why are squeamish about stating ''basic facts''? Are you afraid people will draw conclusions which you are not in favor of? In closing, I am more than willing to discuss meaningful issues such here on these Talk pages, but if you simply delete basic factual information for some perverse motive beyond my comprehension than I will continue to revert you without bothering to explain.

The information OneVoice wants to add to the Elon article, which you included in your message above, is ''background'' information regarding the conflict, and IMO belongs in the main article on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or one of its offspring. The text which OneVoice wants to remove here are a list of specific elements of the ''proposal'' to resolve the issue, which is a completely different matter. As you may have noticed if you reviewed the history of this page, OneVoice actually included this in his first version, but for some unclear reason removed it shortly thereafter. IMO, an article on such a proposal which doesn't include a brief summary of the key elements is ridiculous. Now, if you look at this edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elon_Peace_Plan&amp;diff=2132284&amp;oldid=2132095] you will see that OneVoice keeps trying ''delete'' a similar text on the Elon proposal, namely   <LF>

As you have seen, the issue is not simply one of formatting but is indeed more substantial. It would appear that OneVoice does not trust readers with the actual facts for fear that they will come to the wrong conclusions, hence he or she would prefer that the details of the respective proposals are not listed in our articles. Having pursued this debate with OneVoice for some time now, I have come to the conclusion that ''negotiating'' these matters with him is futile; he is not interested in an objective representation of these issues; he only wants to promote his ultra-reactionary Zionist ''population transfer'' (a.k.a ''ethnic cleansing'') ideas in Wikipedia. As far as I am concerned, these articles can stay protected until OneVoice gets tired with this game and goes off to some other corner of the Internet to spread his anti-Palestine propaganda.

We have never negoiated regarding the content of pages.  The pages have been editted and reeditted without meaningful dialog.

And as you see, the current [[union (computer science)|union]] article is really about untagged union and is not so good actually. If not merge, another option would be let tagged union be a new [[union (computer science)|union]] and the current [[union (computer science)|union]] article to be [[untagged union]].

The word ''union'' by itself almost exclusively refers to untagged unions, both in the literature and in popular culture (where it's used almost entirely in the C/C++ community). Tagged unions are not called ''tagged unions'' quite so often, however. In literature they're generally called discriminated or disjoint unions, but these terms are often considered to refer to the pure mathematical set theory concept. As a programming concept about the closest thing is ML's '''datatype''' construction, which is obviously an ambiguous term. The term ''tagged union'' is fairly widely used and understood, and avoids the problems with other terms, but to many it seems to imply a particular implementation (the use of an explicit tag field), which isn't quite what I intende

But the question is do we need a separate article about untagged unions. I doubt the current [[union (computer science)]] will grow in the way there is little overlap with [[tagged union]]. I know that a name union particularly gives an impression of union type in C. But the article should be about a concept of union datatype in general and I don't think there are a lot to say about unions without the way of type checking, or tagging. I think we use terms like discriminated unions or such because we want to emphasize they are tagged, like we say static type checking instead of just type checking. But discussing the general concept, we don't have to be too specific. If you really want to see a name tagged and to avoid a false impression, we can name the combined article &quot;[[tagged and untagged union]]&quot;, &quot;[[union datatype]]&quot; or something, though I think it is unnecessary.

The [[variant type]] article is of a low quality, covering too narrow a context and just being confusing.

Granted, the [[variant type]] article is of a low quality as you say, and certainly could be improved to cover other languages that feature variant typing.  But variant typing and tagged unions are far too different to be merged.  One is a compile-time check on how much memory a particular symbol represents, while the other is a run-time feature for dynamic typing.  In Visual Basic, a [[variant type]] is essentially a reference that is not strongly typed until runtime.   <LF>

Anyone with access to a computer can find out for themselves that, just like everyone else and every other organisation on the planet, the Mayo Clinic has skeletons in its closets. It is more that I wanted to criticise Wikipedia for allowing what I thought was a just a syrupy sales puff piece for the Mayo Clinic rather than a scholarly encyclopedic statement.  It was so blatant that IMO it was written by some Mayo Clinic P.R. hack.  A sort of amalgam of their sales brochures.   <LF>   *If you start having criticism sections couldn't it lead to anyone with an axe to grind about the subject of any entry having a field day?

Reading it feels like reading an advertisement for Mayo -- it's not at all the normal WP feeling.  Bragging, comparative words like &quot;more than&quot; are severely overused.  Rankings are severely over-emphasized.  I'm really not that surprised, given how many times I've visited Mayo Clinic's articles and been graced with the numerous, large advertisements interspersed with the medical information I'm looking for.  As my opinion of this institution declines, I'm becoming more and more interested in those 'skeletons in the closet' that someone else mentioned.  Think I'll head off now to search for them and balance out the amount of glittered hype that I've just read!  Really hope some folks can beat this back into a neutral article.  And ''Mayo Clinic people -- please, back off and let others fix this.  You're hurting your credibility.

But, have no fear, everything has been preserved; it's just been reorganized.  As you can see, I've created links to what could be the articles for other uses of the term &quot;a priori&quot;, such as [[a priori (math modeling)]].  I've created an article called ''a priori (philosophy)'' for the philosophy one, except it redirects to the new [[a priori and a posteriori (philosophy)]] article&amp;mdash;see below under &quot;Merge&quot; for more on that. I hope I haven't stepped on anyone's toes.  I just thought that it would have been too confusing, time-consuming, and otherwise difficult to try and spell out how to reorganize all this on the talk page.  So, instead, I just did, so everyone can see.  It really seems like an obvious and intuitive way to organize things.  I really hope that the [[a priori and a posteriori (philosophy)]] entry can get polished up more too on it's own.

Certainly the '''official''' line is that romantic love is a recent development, but the official line on premarital [[chastity|unchastity]] is the same, and pregnant-at-the-altar statistics do not bear that out (and I believe without evidence that one of the longest ongoing projects in medical science was the search for an oral contraceptive). It's possible that, just as (as mentioned in the article) matchmakers frequently did little more than rubber-stamp decisions the parents had already made, they and parents often did little more than sign off on the prospective spouses' own choice (i.e., of each other). Anyway, if romantic love was non-existant or unimportant until the [[13th century]] CE, how did [[Hero and Leander|Leander]] drown?

It was agreed a long time ago that all maps should show the empire in purple, after lengthy discussion. Check the archives for further details. Please, the bright red colour of the 1180 map is hideous, damages the look of the article, and is not consistent with the agreed standard. There are other maps which show the empire in green, and for consistency they should really be changed too. However, I am willing to overlook this, since at least they are pleasant to look at. The red, however, is an unsightly abberration, and really should be changed as soon as possible by anyone who has the time/ability to do so. Much thank

It really does make the eyesockets bleed to see such a horrible bright red colour representing the empire. Furthermore, the borders it depicts are not even quite accurate either; the empire extends a little too far to the west in the Balkans. I understand that it's nice to have the empire's neighbours, but they could just be added to this map [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Byzantium1170lightpurple.PNG], and it would be more historically accurate and look much better too.

(I added a couple of words since AdrianCo's last edit to clarify)   <LF>   So in terms of the ''foremost research center of Europe'', certainly this is a very true in the very early Middle Ages. After that, before the rise of [[Al-Andalus]] this is technically true although it is rather like saying today Riyadh is the research center of Saudia Arabia (it is probably true although Saudia Arabia is not particularly a hotbed of scientific research in general, not to say anything bad about the Saudis, of course). By the late first millenium Al-Andalus was by far the research center of Europe and, of course, the other major research centers of the Mediterranean region were not in Europe.   <LF>   So certainly there was substantial scholarship in the the ERE throughout its life (in other words, there were many scholars who kept up with and disseminated the scientific achievements of others) and there were practical innovations throughout as well. But most true scientific advancement in the Empire had halted by the 6th (maybe 7th) century (if you know of authors who dispute this please provide references). There were exceptions but it was mostly the Muslims who carried the torch until the Renaissance and the modern era.   <LF>

As a side note it should be pointed out that many scholars have argued that the Romans in general, even before the fall of Rome, were never particularly known for scientific innovation. They were always known to be good at learning from others and applying that knowledge. Still once Rome acquired the Greek world scientific investigation did continue, especially in Egypt, but once Egypt and so many other territories were finally lost to the Arabs the imperative toward further discovery largely passed to the Muslims.

But, as I understand it, their military success in defending the Empire was due primarily to 3 things:   <LF>   * Superior strategies: Certainly extremely important but this is not &quot;science&quot;, per se.   <LF>   * The Walls of Theodosius: These were completed before the end of the 6th century (granted there was some other construction done later but never again on the same scale). Even at that the walls were more an &quot;engineering&quot; accomplishment than a &quot;scientific&quot; one.   <LF>   * Some very specific military technologies, especially Greek Fire: Arguably there were some scientific contributions made in developing these technologies but nothing earth-shattering. Most of their later military technology was based on classical science or things they learned from the Arabs and Persians. What they were always good at, since the days of Rome, was recognizing what was the best solution to a problem.   <LF>   Regarding the list of scientists you should read that list more carefully. Mostly the scientists who could be argued to have made significant advances are ones that lived very early in the Middle Ages. The scientists from later eras are mostly people whose contribution was education, translation, and/or compilation of knowledge from earlier eras or from scientists in other nations. It's not that these people were not very intelligent and very well versed in the latest science of their time but they mostly did not make original contributions to science. The major advancements in science during the Middle Ages, at least outside of China, mostly came from the Muslims (including Al-Andalus, Persia, etc.).   <LF>   Regarding specifically the accomplishments of Al-Andalus, you should look up people like [[Abulcasis]], [[Arzachel]], and [[Ibn al-Baitar]]. The Wikipedia articles don't really do these guys justice but they made huge contributions. Translations of Ibn al-Baitar's medical encyclopedia, for example, were used as reference materials in Europe as late as the 19th century.   <LF>

Out of the three man that you pointed out to one was born in Al-Andaluz but traveled the mediterranean around. They are great man indeed! And scientists!

In any event, to respond to your comments:   <LF>   * Strictly speaking it does not matter if a work is from 1904 or 904. If a reference is reasonably authoritative and reflective of modern consensus then it is acceptable.

Otherwise I don't know what your point is.   <LF>   * Regarding the &quot;Science and Religion&quot; book:   <LF>

Granted you could loosely suggest that the change in Western attitudes may have been because the Easterners had these attitudes but the text does not actually say this.   <LF>   :# Regardless of any of it, the quote (and the rest of the text that you haven't included) is only saying that the Christians were more willing to learn science from others not that they were motivated to do their own investigations.   <LF>   I do not see a valid justification of why these would be left out.   <LF>   If I may suggest I think the issue you are having has more to do with not liking that the statement casts the Empire in a less favorable light than you would like. I understand that sentiment but it's not really relevant. Perhaps what you want is to rephrase the statement or add more to the section to elucidate the sophistication and achievements of the ERE. I do think, though, it is important to bring out the fact that in the later centuries their accomplishments were more a matter of putting science to good use rather than inherently developing the science themselves. The Arabs, Persians, etc. deserve a lot of credit, both for helping to preserve a lot of the ancient Greek (and Hindu and Persian) knowledge but more for being responsible for most of the scientific progress of the Middle Ages. The Eastern Romans, by contrast, deserve credit for   <LF>   * Educating the Muslims and Westerners in the first place.   <LF>   * Providing a powerful stabilizing influence in the region economically and militarily which I would argue actually benefited the Arabs and Persians and made a lot of their progress possible.   <LF>   * Developing ways to put the science that was being developed into practice in terms of &quot;engineering&quot; accomplishments, and for helping to compile and disseminate knowledge around the Mediterranean.   <LF>

So how can we compare China to the ERE to the Caliphate of Baghdad when they are worlds apart? '''That was my reason'''! As for the 1904 source...the problem is that it is not from the contemporan era... now, If i recall the main opposition to having Edward Gibbon as a souce was that he was not &quot;a modern source&quot;.

It is known that the ERE and China did exchange embassies and had regular contact at various times. I'm not sure it can be argued that Baghdad and the ERE were so far apart. Certainly there was enmity due to religion and other rivalries that kept them much more separate that the Muslim lands were to each other. But the ERE had substantial contact with all Muslim lands around the Mediterranean and near East including trade and (limited) scholarly exchanges. Obviously this varied with how close to war they were at any given time but it would be wrong to suggest that they they didn't know much about each other. Certainly, though, the Arabs knew a lot more about Persia that the ERE did. Regardless, whether any of these nations were talking to each other or not is not in and of itself relevant to who was making major scientific contributions or not.   <LF>   Regarding Gibbon, first I am not aware that it has been stated that he is completely dismissed. It is true that many of his opinions do not agree with modern consensus and so those opinions should be dismissed on that basis. If there are significant modern sources that disagree with the 1904 source then, yes, it should be dismissed. But the fact that the book is a century old isn't by itself significant. In any event, I have provided very recent sources which say the same basic things (albeit perhaps a little less harsh).   <LF>   In any event, I am unclear what exactly is your stand at this point. Are you saying that there were many Eastern Roman scholars in the later eras that were pushing the frontiers of science? You gave a list but didn't really respond about how each pushed science forward. The major accomplishments of the folks during the later &quot;Byzantine Renaissance&quot; were to a great degree grasping the progress that the Muslims (and Hindus) had been making (much like the Western European Renaissance). This does not mean that it did not take some true intelligence or even genius to try to grasp these complex works written by foreign cultures and it is not that they did not apply this knowledge in novel ways, but still this is different than producing original research and theory.   <LF>   
3973	3972	35	34	1	3720	3720	3957	-1	-1	780	785	AdrianCo	Mcorazao	-1	:I would re-add Gibbon as a source, but even thinking of that war I had back then makes me shiver. Well ok, can you tell me if there were '''any''' breakthroughs in science in the middle ages. The only ones I could think of, world-wide are: gunpowder(China) , the sesonal rotation of crops(all over Europe-not sure if this is the correct translation in english) and windmills(Iran/Northwest Europe). So in the sense of over all concrete reserch no one can be atributed to have such a great impact in reserch. As for Iranian-ERE Concatcts(or Iran-Europe in general)...let me just point out that the [[Nicene Creed]] find it`s way to Iran only a hundread years after the First Ecoumenical Council...I think everyone can grasp the extent of communications of the two cultures back then...let`s just say that the middle ages and the rise of islam(and downfall of zoroastroanism) were not factors of improving communication.    <LF>   :I think we both understand our point of views, but the current formulation appears to me somewhat flowed. So! Would you agree if we had a formulation such as: &quot;in the Christian cultural-world the ERE had a lead role throughout the middle ages(dispite the slow down during it`s late stages it is was arguable the most advanced) however after the 6/7th century the Islamic world and China got the upper hand&quot;. Not sure though...this formulation would be correct, but still I don`t think that we can compare those three worlds. What do you thin

Any discussion of &quot;why&quot; that would fit in the lead would be of necessity far too simplistic.

That's what the Latins called it, and it's good to know, but doesn't need any exegesis in the first paragraph. I would also reiterate my opinion, often stated, that this whole &quot;Byzantium bulwark of Christendom&quot; line is kind of ridiculous. The Muslims made it to Europe anyways (Spain, Sicily), and after the Umayyads -- who may have had in mind essentilly overrunning Europe -- no later Muslim power showed ''any'' interest in pushing through Byzantium until the Ottomans. (i.e. the Sejluks just wanted Anatolia).

We can however extrapolate that when the Muslims were in a position to conquer Europe, as with the Ottomans or with the Moors they attempted so. Meanwhile the Arabs constantly waged war were they could, against India, China with the aid of Turkish slave soldiers and more importantly against the Byzantine Empire, whose plurality in Greek culture and Christian majority make it somewhat of a European state. Finally, the Arabs made numerous attempts against southern Italy, Sicily, Crete, Greece (Sack of Thessalonika in 902), Sardinia and Illyria. The Holy Roman Empire proved relatively ineffective against these threats until Byzantium cleared Illyrium and southern Italy and the Normans Sicily. So you see, whenever the Muslims did have the opportunity to conquer Europe, they took it. Whenever they did not, it was because Byzantium stood in the way. I hope that this is a convincing argument

And when he posted to my talk page referring to his Catholic motivations, I was really surprised. I had expected this topic to be simply historical, innocent of sectarian conflict. But I expected too much. Again, the lead is way better than it was back when it was &quot;perfect,&quot; so thanks everyon

Regarding the comment about denying Roman heritage although this is true but it is a very sensitive and complex issue and, so, should not be mentioned without being very clear about the context.

I don't exactly disagree with you but these sorts of statements are inherently POV in they seem to imply one thing when the reality is much more complex. Social scientists in general try to be careful about discussing race and ethnicity today because races intermix and ethnicity is simply a matter of which group one chooses to identify with. When you say the Balkans or Asia Minor were very Greek what this is really saying is that the people who inhabited these regions all identified strongly with Greek history and saw themselves as descending from that culture. But, be that as it may, the ancestors of the Byzantines in these areas came from a lot of different places. It was not true that Asia Minor was mostly inbred for the whole Byzantine period. It's rather like saying that England has always been inhabited primarily by Englishmen. This is inherently true simply because any immigrants after a generation or two consider themselves Englishmen. Yes there are minority groups that maintain a distinct identify but it would be fallacious to think that anybody who considers themselves a true Englishmen must be directly and solely descended from the original Saxons who gave the country its language.   <LF>   So in this context saying that the dominant population was primarily &quot;Greek&quot; is at best misleading and, IMHO, not all that meaningful. But again, that's just my opinion.   <LF>

We should base our understanding of the Byzantine Empire based on direct evidence (wherever available). Multiple historical sources indicate that the Byzantine Empire did have a &quot;Greek identity&quot; (i.e. ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and demographic) even if that identity took centuries for it to become more prevalent and pervasive in Byzantine affairs. Moreover, there are multiple Wikipedia articles that treat this particular aspect of the Byzantine Empire with sourced content (i.e. [[Byzantine Greeks]]). Nevertheless, to simply state that ethnicity is simply a matter of choice naively ignores (or at least downplays) the potential ascriptive nature of ethnic identity. Therefore, it is unwise to use the English as an example in order to prove that the Greeks possessed an unadultered form of non-ascriptive self-identity. History indicates that the Greeks have always possessed a multifaceted identity that embodies descent (i.e. kinship ties), culture, language, and religion. It is because of this multifaceted dynamic that the Greeks were able to preserve their identity and persevere in times of crisis. Of course, I really don't care about all of this since there are other articles that need improving. Late

From a logical standpoint, all empires exhibit forms of &quot;pluralism&quot; and the Byzantine Empire is no exception to that general rule. However, the fact that the Greeks were the majority population of the Byzantine Empire should permit the use of the term &quot;presence&quot; instead of &quot;plurality&quot;.

There is a discussion taking place and the issues are still debated, therefore why the rush to take out the elements of culture and population, especially as there is no consensus yet that they be removed. I also agree with you on the point of culture. The Empire was of course comprised of many cultures, but there is no doubt that Greek was the dominant culture.  So I do not agree with the removal of the culture component. We had this discussion before and I participated in it. Now we revisit it under the guise of refurbishing the intro and presto, in mid discussion about refurbishing the intro, a valid reference to culture (and even population) goes out of the window.

At the outset of the Empire one could say that it was simply &quot;Roman Christianity&quot; as East and West were one Church. However, even at the time of the fall of Rome the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were fairly divided. For the rest of its life Constantinople was the undisputed head of Eastern Orthodoxy. When the Empire fell apart, of course, the other parts of Eastern Orthodoxy asserted themselves and their independence but that was later. And there is the obvious aspect that Eastern Orthodox and Greek Orthodox are modern inventions and had no meaning at the time of the BE.   <LF>   :In any event, from my perspective Eastern Orthodoxy is a single communion and, therefore, in my view one religion, the same religion as that practiced by the Byzantines. The Greek Orthodox Church is simply a division of that religion albeit a very significant one historically. Obviously most Greeks today would argue that Greek Orthodoxy is the division that inherited most directly from the Byzantines but many Russians and other Orthodox would strongly dispute that. For both those reasons I suggest that it is much more POV to say the religion was Greek Orthodox rather than Eastern Orthodox. But as I say, since these terms are more modern inventions used to refer to the modern religions the argument for either one is a little weak to begin with. Probably the only label that would not be controversial is Christianity, which I would not object to either (actually regardless of what is kept it is probably good to add &quot;Christianity&quot; to the description anyway for the sake of the novice).   <LF>

The people of the empire considered themselves &quot;Romans&quot; (&quot;Byzantine&quot; is another modern, Western term--which is actually innacurate, since the city had ceased to be called &quot;Byzantium&quot; in the time of Constantine I).  The use by Westerners of the term &quot;Greeks&quot; to refer to the Eastern Romans was (rightly or wrongly) interpreted by them as an insult, and an attempt to hijack the heritage of the Roman Empire as an exclusively Western possesion by excluding the Eastern Romans from it.

While many English speakers may mistakenly use the term &quot;Greek Orthodox&quot; to refer to the entire Eastern Orthodox Church, it is inaccurate--an inaccuracy that most modern encyclopedias do not perpetuate. As far as usage on Wikipedia is concerned, if you look at the articles [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], you will see what I mean. As for the assertion that &quot;The Greek Orthodox liturgy has always been chanted in Koine Greek, never the contemporary vernacular&quot;, this is also inaccurate (presuming that you are using the term &quot;Greek Orthodox&quot; interchangeably with &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot;).  The scripture and the divine services were translated into [[Slavonic]] in the ninth century by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]]--and this was done under the auspices of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The same holds true for the [[Baptism of Rus']] (988), where Greek bishops were sent to a land where the services were done in Slavonic.  In the early history of the empire, the churches of Bulgaria, Serbia and Rus' were a part of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, though they were not within the borders of the empire. They were not Greek either by ethnicity or language, but they were part of the same faith. The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], which has existed since 327 does the services in its own language. Though I'm sure at one point they did at least a portion of them in Greek, there are quite ancient inscriptions and liturgical manuscripts written in Georgian (see photo, above right). In fact, nowadays, almost all of the various national churches which together make up the Eastern Orthodox Church do the services in a language understood by the people (though not necessarily the modern vernacular idiom). You are correct that the patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem have continued to be under Greek hegemony, and are therefore rightly considered to be a part of the Greek Orthodox Church.  Their identity as &quot;Greek&quot; is the result of the complex history of the Middle East. After the Muslim conquests, these patriarchs had to depend upon Constantinople for survival. After the fall of Constantionople, the Orthodox peoples were treated as a seperate ethnicity by the Ottomans, and the Patriarch was made their ''enthnarch'' (ruler of the ethnicity). After this, their Hellenic culture came to be seen as part and parcel of their Christianity (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)]]). This is, however, breaking down in some places today. A debate about just this subject is ocurring within the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, where most of the senior clergy are Greek, but most of the faithful are Ara

The term &quot;Greek Orthodox Church&quot; refers to the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Greece in the strict sense and in Greek speaking Eastern Orthodox Churches (eg the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Church of Cyprus etc) in general. It is a term that refers to an administrative subdomain, NOT a different religion, or dogma, or communion or whatever.    <LF>   The Church is One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic (it's in the -Byzantine authored- [[Nicene Creed|Creed]] for Chrissakes!) and from the point of view of us Eastern Christians, the religion is called &quot;Orthodox Christian&quot;, period. However, since in Wikipedia we use the most commonly used English term, the same religious entity is compromisingly called the &quot;Eastern Orthodox Church&quot;.   <LF>   All claims above that somehow Greek Orthodoxy is different from Russian or Romanian or Bulgarian or Zimbabwean Orthodoxy are simply incorrect from any perspective (call it historical, religious, ecclesiological, whatever). A different leiturgical language does not qualify as a different religion, not in Orthodoxy that is. Personally, I find such claims offensive to my faith and  even heretical (the heresy of &quot;ÎµÎ¸Î½Î¿Ï†Ï…Î»ÎµÏ„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼ÏŒÏ‚&quot; has been condemned by a Synod in 1872). --[[User:Michalis Famelis|Michalis Famelis

The Byzantines did actually go through a period where scholarship waned which roughly coincided with the Western Dark Ages. But it is true that the term more applies to the West.

But, for example, if I say that the Roman Empire was the most powerful nation in the world this is a correct statement. The RE did not exist in all of the world but it was more powerful than the other states. Similarly the BE did not exist in all of Europe but was more power powerful than the others in Europe. What we intended was to say that in that part of the world there was no equal.   <LF>   ::#&quot;Medieval Christian empire of Greek culture&quot; - well, yes and no. Realistically for much of the Middle Ages they rejected much of the classical Greek culture. The culture was more a &quot;Christian&quot; culture (something new that they invented) that had elements of many cultures. But the &quot;Christian&quot; culture was also not homogeneous. Each time it lost territory the culture became more homogeneous and at the end the culture probably was the same throughout all the Empire. What I am saying is two things: a) In my opinion it is an exaggeration to imply that the Byzantine culture was homogeneous. b) Using &quot;Greek culture&quot; without explanation can be interpreted in various ways. There were many important differences between the cultures of Ancient Greece, the Greek-speaking part of the classical Roman Empire, and the Byzantine Empire.   <LF>   ::# &quot;heir to the Roman Empire&quot; - well, I don't like it a lot but it's not a big problem.   <LF>   ::#I don't care much. We put the information about Nicomedia only to explain where the capital was moved from.   <LF>   ::#Yes, it is vague and maybe there is something better that we can say. About the Muslims and the Byzantines ... what I know is this. During the &quot;Byzantine renaissance&quot; the Byzantines became experts in Muslim learning. At the beginning the Western Europeans learned about this knowledge from the Byzantines. Later they began to translate the Islamic works directly. But also there is a lot of knowledge from the Byzantines (i.e. not from Antiquity) that they preserved as well. And also the Islamic cultures were no just one culture. The other thing is that they didn't just preserve the knowledge for Western Europe but also for the Muslims (more at the beginning but the Muslims learned from the Byzantines at various times).   <LF>   ::I'm also letting you know that I have translated our discussion in the English discussion.   <LF>   ::Regards.   <LF>   ::

First of all, is it you who added the section some time ago? From the first moment, I expressed my opinion that this section is not necessary, and it belongs in [[History of the Greek language]] as subsection; not here. In any case, after I first removed the section, I respected its presence and I just tried to improve it, and make it a bit more concise. I repeat all the time, that the article is getting again too long and that we may have a problem with FAR. So, if you think the language section is absolutely necessary, keep it but make it more concise, and include the majority of the current details in [[History of the Greek language]] per [[WP:SS]].   <LF>   Secondly, the article, Mcorazao, is FA and, therefore, it should adhere to the FA criteria, which is not the case with this section. What are the problems? Let me just mention some of them:   <LF>   *Why does the author of the section break the citations' consistency? For instance, why didn't he merge citations 150 and 151 in one citation per 138 for instance? Why aren't the printed sources of citations 146-151 included in the References section? Well, I did included them, but unfortunately your revert deleted my edits; I am obliged to say that I am sorry for that.   <LF>   *Where is the ISBN and the other data of citation 147? And where is the page? I repeat that since the article is FA, printed sources should have pages. So, citation 147 should have the author, the book and the page per all the other citations' consistent formatting (we can't have one citation layout for this section and one for all the other section!), and the full data of the book should be included in the &quot;References&quot; section. The author of the section took care of none of these things.   <LF>   *The online source of citation 148 is again not included in the References section (and, of course, [[Template:cite web]] is not used). And again when I click on the link, I go to a page where I do not see the full article. How can I check the verifiability of your source? Probably, I have to check my CD version of Britannica.   <LF>   *In citation 149 we need page instead of chapter. And again the full data of the book belong to the References section.    <LF>   *Citation 151 is again a mess.   <LF>   *Let's go to the content: What meaning did my edits of the first paragraph change? I just placed an info from the &quot;Heraclius&quot; section here, which info clarifies the time and the way Greek became official, and provides sources (The first paragraph has no citation! Mcorazao, in a FA we are obliged to [[WP:VERIFIABILITY|verify]] everything we write, using [[WP:CITE|citations]]). In this way, we also avoid repetition, because the same info with the current status of the article is repeated three times: in the lead and in two section!   <LF>   *I have the right to remove any assertion or material which is uncited. So, please provide sources for the following assertions: &quot;Even afterward Latin continued to be a ceremonial part of the Empire's culture (e.g. the last coins with Latin inscriptions were minted in the 11th century) and Vulgar Latin continued to be used by minority groups in the Empire (possibly the origin of the Vlach, or Eastern Romance, languages).&quot; If verifiable sources are not provided, I'll remove this sentence.   <LF>   *I'll also remove any further material which is not properly verified. And to be more specific, I refer to assertions like this one: &quot;Indeed early on in the life of the Roman Empire Greek had become the common language in the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations.&quot;, where the cited book has no page.   <LF>   *Please, provide proper citations as defined above for the following assertions: &quot;Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in Egypt, Armenia, and Georgia, respectively. Contact with the Slavs and Vlachs, and incursions by the Arabs made the Slavonic, Vlach, and Arabic languages important in the Empire and its sphere of influence&quot;, and &quot;As the Empire entered its final decline the Empire's citizens became more culturally homogeneous and the Greek language became synonymous with their identity and their religion.&quot; And after you provide citations, include the sources you use properly in the References section.   <LF>   I repeat that IMO the section should be a bit more concise, and most of its content belongs in [[History of the Greek language]] or [[Medieval Greek]] per WP:SS. In any case, however, it should be properly cited.

Most of your comments and questions here, although important, are tangential (i.e. they don't deal with the question I asked). For the sake of not confusing issues, I'll ignore those here. If you'd like to go ahead and discuss those (which I assume you do) let's open a new sub-section.   <LF>   :To respond to the relevant comments:   <LF>   :* ''Even afterward Latin continued to be a ceremonial part of the Empire's culture ...'' - Fair enough but you did not explain your reasoning when you removed this. I'll add citations.   <LF>   :* ''I just placed an info from the &quot;Heraclius&quot; section here ...'' - I have no issue specifically with mentioning Heraclius here. I will point out that I had earlier mentioned Heraclius and taken that detail out for specifically the reason that I was attempting to shorten the section. So in a sense you seem to be contradicting yourself. But if you feel that particular detail needs to be added, feel free.   <LF>   :* You didn't offer an explanation of moving the final sentence. The sentence made sense in its original location but seemed rather meaningless in the location you placed it (i.e. mentioning the Empire's becoming linguistically homogeneous before mentioning its linguistic heterogeneity seems odd).   <LF>   Thanks.   <LF>   :

Allow me to point out that there are no &quot;tangential issues&quot;, since they are all related to the article's quality, and to the sections's content, extent, and necessity. For instance, the issue of the very existence of this section, the following of the [[WP:SS]] guide and the section's relation with the [[History of the Greek language]] and [[Medieval Greek]] articles are nothing but tangential. After all, these &quot;tangential&quot; for you issues led me to edit this section, in an attempt to improve it and conform it with FA rules. Now, let's go to the three points you segmentally responded:   <LF>   ::*It was uncited, and IMO going into too many details. Add citations and we'll see. It is not bad to have the section a bit more concise like all the others in the &quot;Culture&quot; part of the article.   <LF>   ::*No, Mcorazao, I do not contradict myself, because, before adding this sentence, I removed the previous uncited and vague IMO introduction (&quot;this continued to be the official language of the Empire until the 6th century AD when it changed to [[Greek language|Greek]]&quot;; &quot;it changed to Greek&quot; how? By a divine hand?!). So I did shortened the section and I did added citations, with what I believed to be a better introductory sentence compared to the previous one (by the way when you restored your previous version of the section, you forgot to restore my introduction you did not like to its previous place).   <LF>   ::*So you feel that this sentence makes more sense after the &quot;chinese&quot; and not after the &quot;Koine&quot;, when it gives the sequence of the Byzantine linguistic tradition. Respectfully, allow me to strongly disagree.

The discussion of the minority groups (Vlachs) was added because another author was upset that the Vlachs were not even mentioned. The mention about the use of Latin ceremonially is there simply because it is a popular misconception (popularized to some extent because of agenda's by some earlier scholars) that the BE was always divorced from Roman culture and language. It is actually a valuable point to clarify for the uninitiated. But perhaps this can be stated more concisely.   <LF>   :* As I said, up to you if you want to include Heraclius. I don't think anybody would believe that a divine figure was involved but if you do please add Heraclius back in. As I mentioned, I did have Heraclius in there originally.   <LF>   :* Well, yes. I'm not sure what else to say. If it has only talked about the Greek-speaking populous up to that point then how is it meaningful to say they became more Greek-speaking?   <LF>   :

This strongly implies that before this date it was a Byzantine possession, why do no maps show the fact that a number of inland Balkan fortified cities, such as Philippopolis, Markellai and Makrolivadia etc were in Byzantine hands for much of the period prior to Symeon?   <LF>   OK the Byzantine presence in inland Thrace was chiefly military and confined to strategic fortified settlements and the countryside was inhabited by Slav tribes, but there was a presence and it should be noted on maps.   <LF>

I reverted once the edit (but I will not come back again), and I'll explain why I regard both the &quot;Greek-speaking&quot; part and the long list of references as redundant:   <LF>   1) In the same paragraph of the lead I read &quot;Due to the dominance of Medieval Greek language, culture and population ... &quot; So the lead underscores and emphasizes with the most vivid way not only on the Greek language, but on the Greek culture and population as well. Then why is the &quot;Greek-speaking&quot; part necessary to be added just two lines above? IMO it is redundant and makes this part of the (so much debated!) lead repetitive. The dominance of the Greek civilization is well-expressed.   <LF>   2) Along with the &quot;Greek-speaking&quot; part I also saw the addition of a looong series of citations of mainly inline encyclopedias. Why is this necessary for something so obvious and acceptable, and already cited at the end of the paragraph. And for something further cited with highly esteemed printed sources in the &quot;language&quot; section. For all these reasons (extensive citing in the &quot;Language&quot; section, not necessary in Wikipedia to cite the obvious) and for the additional reason that per [[WP:LEAD]] the citing of the lead should be careful and limited, since it is not necessary to cite facts or assessments developed in the main article, I do not agree with the inclusion of these long series of references. They are some general inline encyclopedias (why are they necessary when we have the specialized printed sources of the &quot;Language&quot; section fully in compliance with [[WP:VERIFY]]?), citing nothing more than what is already in detail cited in the &quot;Language&quot; section.   <LF>   These are my thoughts based on the rationale that repetitions, useless insistance on the obvious, and overlapping and overwhelming citing have nothing to do with this high-quality (even higher that after the closing of the FAR thanks to the efforts of users such as Tourskin, Mcorazao etc.) level of the article.

I did not contribute either the recent or original &quot;Greek-speaking&quot; edit, the credit goes to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=212553037&amp;oldid=212487021 this user]for the recent version.

Recently I saw this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=212600059&amp;oldid=212553037 this edit] and I simply reverted it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=212606898&amp;oldid=212600059 here]. This slow motion dispute originally started around this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=193372108&amp;oldid=193354830 point] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=193374434&amp;oldid=193372108 continued here]  and finished [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=193384539&amp;oldid=193374663 here]. Therefore I thought this edit was being reverted after I had restored it with citations in the past and naturally I disagreed and wondered why the citations were removed yet again. If you see the edit summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_Empire&amp;diff=212600059&amp;oldid=212553037 here] makes no mention of your redundancy arguments. Therefore I was acting from a historical perspective (since this edit was removed in the past and for the same, wrong in my opinion, reason). So although I was aware of the more recent edits by Mcorazao and Tourskin, I did not check if either of these gentlemen added the disputed &quot;Greek speaking&quot; characterisation, neither did I read the Wikipedia editor's manual  before I reverted. I was simply disagreeing with the edit summary provided and simply reacted to that as I did in the past. Your comments do raise a valid issue however. Does someone revert spontaneously to a given edit he/she disagrees with, for whatever reason, or should someone consult the discussion page, page edit history, article status, Wikipedia manual etc. before proceeding? The latter approach, provides a more global perspective and clearly, in an ideal world, should be preferred. Unfortunately in this case, as the evidence shows, I was caught in a time warp. Tasos

The reader has to understand that the empire managed to become the most powerful state of its time with [[Basil II]] and the Macedonian Dynasty. It is not proper to judge the power of a state only by its extent which Justinian achieved but this expansion exhausted the empire.

Justinian's empire is too similar to the late unified Roman Empire - being roughly only 150 years apart from Theodosius' unified empire. Basil II however, succeeded in reversing the continued erosion of the empire that had began, well, after Justinian's death. The 1025 map shows the apogee of the anachronistic empire that this very article is trying to advertise.

A year during Heraclius' reign should however be given as the start of the &quot;Byzantine&quot; Empire, considering it is he who made most of the reforms that we today somehow justify as a reconstitution of the Roman Empire.

Honestly I believe the Byzantine article is important and large enough, and lasted so long, that it should include several maps (1. 330, 2. 565, 3. 750, 4. 1025, 5. 1210, 6. 1275, and 7. 1450). The map thumbnails can be made small enough to fit snugly within the article, without looking out of place.

Therefore, what is tiring is your insistence on reinstating the map that you like or to put the two maps together (making the infobox extremely long and &quot;tiring&quot;) as some kind of compromise you decided yourself and implemented yourself, despite the fact that none of your proposals succeeded consensus here until now. Personally, I think that you should refrain from such tactics. Now, about Talessman's proposal, as far as I am concerned I like it, and if most of the users here agree, I have no problem to see it implemented. Although I must admit I've seen a trend in Wikipedia against this kind of animated maps. As a matter of fact, some time ago I had seen such a map in our infobox, but, when I checked it again a few months later, I saw it replaced by the current more &quot;banal&quot; map!

The broken partnership can be between a husband and a wife, a boss and the employee, a Muslim and a Hindu, or Israel and Palestine. Peace-building, and even human development, is ultimately about establishing correct, constructive, mutually beneficial relationships.

In other words, &quot;dispute resolution&quot; focuses on resolving one issue, regardless of the relationship.  &quot;conflict resolution&quot; focuses on fixing a relationship; clearing up any conflicts for the end goal of enabling a working relationship.  &lt;small&gt;â€”

If so, or if no one knows, the article should state that &quot;Aquinas considers&quot; the process to be infalliable until other evidence can be presente
4328	4327	8	7	1	188939	356958	4326	-1	-1	-1	839	-1	Pmadrid	-1	First, I would say that an Aquinas quote is sufficient enough, since he is considered one of the foremost Catholic theologians; one must remember that, in his time, the Catholic theologians argued according to the faith. Aquinas did not add initial ideas to the theology, he merely refined and explained them with Aristotlean (sp?) logic. We musn't forget that Pope Leo XIII pushed for the use of St. Thomas Aquinas as the basis of Catholic theology--see his encyclical letter entitled, &quot;On the Restoration of the Christian Philosophy According to the Mind of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor.&quot; Plus Cannon 1366, issued by Pope Benedict XV: &quot;The study of philosophy and theology and the teaching of these sciences to their students must be accurately carried out by professors (in seminaries, etc) according to the arguments, doctrine, and principles of S. Thomas, which they are iviolately to hold.&quot;    <LF>   Then, on the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm    &quot;Is the pope infallible in issuing a decree of canonization? Most theologians answer in the affirmative. It is the opinion of St. Antoninus, Melchior Cano, Suarez, Bellarmine, BaÃ±ez, Vasquez, and, among the canonists, of Gonzales Tellez, Fagnanus, SchmalzgrÃ¼ber, Barbosa, ReiffenstÃ¼l, Covarruvias (Variar. resol., I, x, no 13), Albitius (De InconstantiÃ¢ in fide, xi, no 205), Petra (Comm. in Const. Apost., I, in notes to Const. I, Alex., III, no 17 sqq.), Joannes a S. ThomÃ¢ (on II-II, Q. I, disp. 9, a. 2), Silvester (Summa, s. v. Canonizatio), Del Bene (De Officio Inquisit. II, dub. 253), and many others. In Quodlib. IX, a. 16, St. Thomas says: &quot;Since the honour we pay the saints is in a certain sense a profession of faith, i.e., a belief in the glory of the Saints [quÃ¢ sanctorum gloriam credimus] we must piously believe that in this matter also the judgment of the Church is not liable to error.&quot; These words of St. Thomas, as is evident from the authorities just cited, all favouring a positive infallibility, have been interpreted by his school in favour of papal infallibility in the matter of canonization, and this interpretation is supported by several other passages in the same Quodlibet. This infallibility, however according to the holy doctor, is only a point of pious belief. Theologians generally agree as to the fact of papal infallibility in this matter of canonization, but disagree as to the quality of certitude due to a papal decree in such matter. In the opinion of some it is of faith (Arriaga, De fide, disp. 9, p. 5, no 27); others hold that to refuse assent to such a judgment of the Holy See would be both impious and rash, as Suarez (De fide, disp. 5 p. 8, no 8); many more (and this is the general view) hold such a pronouncement to be theologically certain, not being of Divine Faith as its purport has not been immediately revealed, nor of ecclesiastical Faith as having thus far not been defined by the Church.&quot;   <LF>   I hope that that helps.   <LF>

If you notice from the edits on the page, I came to that conclusion after adding this question once I examined the Catholic Encyclopedia and noticed the other citations.  While Aquinas is an extremely respected theologian and doctor of the church, he is not infalliable, so my concern was whether this sentiment was from consensus among theologians, clarification from a pope or council, or only from Aquinas.  After investigation, I realized it was the first and edited accordingly.   <LF>   :On Wikipedia, we need to be careful when we say something is infallible, because unless there is a definitive statement by the hierarchy, we only have theologians to go off of, and theologians can theoretically make mistakes.

The &quot;pope of Rome&quot; is the successor of St. Peter with universal jurisdiction, East and West, if you are Catholic. Yes, the Orthodox Churches do not recognize that authority, but that's the very point of the difference between the Eastern Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches. DPM and PB are as binding on the East as the West -- it was PB that laid out the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches after all, which is the Eastern Churches' own dicastery! The members of that congregation include all of the Catholic eastern patriarchs and major archbishops, and if you read it, it lays out quite specifically that the other congregations (which have their authority as delegates of the &quot;pope of Rome&quot;) retain their authority, see below:   <LF>   &lt;blockquote&gt;Congregation for the Oriental Churches   <LF>   Art. 56 â€” The Congregation for the Oriental Churches considers those matters, whether concerning persons or things, affecting the Catholic Oriental Churches.   <LF>   Art. 57 â€” Â§ 1.

The consultors and officials are to be selected in such a way as to reflect as far as possible the diversity of rites.   <LF>   Art. 58 â€” Â§ 1. The competence of this Congregation extends to all matters which are proper to the Oriental Churches and which are to be referred to the Apostolic See, whether concerning the structure and organization of the Churches, the exercise of the office of teaching, sanctifying and governing, or the status, rights, and obligations of persons. It also handles everything that has to be done concerning quinquennial reports and the ad limina visits in accordance with arts. 31-32.   <LF>   Â§ 2. This however does not infringe on the proper and exclusive competence of the Congregations for the Doctrine of the Faith and for the Causes of Saints, of the Apostolic Penitentiary, the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura or the Tribunal of the Roman Rota, as well as of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments for what pertains to dispensation from a marriage ratum et non consummatum.   <LF>   In matters which also affect the faithful of the Latin Church, the Congregation will proceed, if the matter is sufficiently important, in consultation with the dicastery that has competence in the same matter for the faithful of the Latin Church.   <LF>   Art. 59 â€” The Congregation pays careful attention to communities of Oriental Christian faithful living within the territories of the Latin Church, and attends to their spiritual needs by providing visitators and even a hierarchy of their own, so far as possible and where numbers and circumstances demand it, in consultation with the Congregation competent for the establishment of particular Churches in that region.   <LF>   Art. 60 â€” In regions where Oriental rites have been preponderant from ancient times, apostolic and missionary activity depends solely on this Congregation, even if it is carried out by missionaries of the Latin Church.   <LF>   Art. 61 â€” The Congregation collaborates with the Council for Promoting Christian Unity in matters which concern relations with non-Catholic Oriental Churches and with the Council for Inter-religious Dialogue in matters within the scope of this Council.   <LF>   &lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   The CCEO was written with help from that congregation, and was applied as per the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Sacri Canones&quot; in 1990 (q.v.).   <LF>   You say you belong to the Russian Catholic Church. I don't know who the &quot;we&quot; are to whom you keep referring as refusing to recognize the &quot;pope of Rome's&quot; jurisdiction, but currently Russian Catholics, while they retain their liturgical rite, answer jurisdictionally to the local Latin rite ordinary -- even in Russia itself, Russian Rite Catholics come under the jurisdiction of Bishop Joseph Werth, SJ, a Lithuanian-born Jesuit who is Bishop of Transfiguration in Novosibirsk, a Latin-Rite jurisdtiction, and who has responsibility (as of January 18, 2005, an act specifically made under and referring to the CCEO) -- so I can't fathom where all of this nobody-pays-attention-to-that-guy-in-Italy thing comes from.   <LF>   Further, you seem to fail to grasp the point of canonization. A &quot;saint&quot; in Catholic definition is someone whom the Church has declared, infallibly, to be worth of such veneration &quot;always and everywhere&quot; -- by definition,even a patriarch has no jurisdiction beyond the limits of his patriarchate, whether that is personal or territorial. Only an ecumenical council or the &quot;pope of Rome&quot; can speak with the voice of the &quot;whole church&quot; with jurisdiction extending to all of the faithful -- I mean, without even having to quote all of the canonical texts above, sheer logic should indicate that as canonization in the sense presented here requires an authority with universal jurisdiction.   <LF>   I get the strong sense that you are confusing the theology of the Orthodox (which you seem to be arguing) with that of the Catholic church.

It seems pretty clear that some European countries do get included in the term &quot;Middle East&quot; from time to time, and there is no dispute that Afganistan, Pakistan, etc. are east of the Ural Mountains, or that Egypt is a part of Africa.

The fact of the matter is that nowhere will you be able to find a definitive LIST of the countries that are to be included in the region defined as the &quot;Middle East&quot; to the exclusion of all others, the way you can find a definitive LIST of States within the continental U.S. to the exclusion of all others (take also the Caribbean Islands as an example, or anything like that).

Someone keeps editing introduction of the article to imply that the term is used primarily in a religous sense. It is clear that the terms &quot;Cradle of Humanity,&quot; &quot;origin of man,&quot; &quot;cradle of civilization,&quot; &quot;birthplace of mankind&quot; do not all mean the same thing and mean different things to different people. However, this article posits that the term &quot;Cradle of Humanity&quot; (note consistent capitals throughout article) was coined in the second century to describe a geographic area that has no other currently used group name than &quot;the Middle East,&quot;  which is riddled with ambiguity. The fact that the people who coined the expression were &quot;religious&quot; and used a religious concept (that may not be popular today, or even correct) as the lynchpin for their term does not mean that the term is not used in the way the article describs. Interestingly, the term &quot;[[West Indies]],&quot; which the article also mentiones in passing is also based on a mistake... namely [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' assumtion that he found India by sailing West. The fact that the term is based on an error, does not mean that it is not used in the way it is used, by the people who use it. Those who object to using a term that happens to be based on an error, can always refer to the West Indies as the [[Caribbean]], and for that matter to the &quot;Cradle of Humanity&quot; as the &quot;[[Middle East]]&quot; if they think that those terms are any less 'eroneous.' [[Culpwit]]   <LF>   You make a sensible argument, [[User:Culpwit|Culpwit]]. But, I think there is no need to assume that someone is trying to &quot;hijack&quot; the term &quot;Cradle of Humanity&quot; as the exclusive label for a group of countries in the Middle East OR for a location in East Africa. There is no reason why the term cannot be used for both. Earlier, someone pointed out that with or without capitals, the term is used by both groups. I think the current version of the article shows both views. However, I am the first to agree that the term &quot;Middle East&quot; can be a bit of an enigma and that people in that region have a right, if they so choose, to revert back to a term that supports their perceived identity â€” even if it is based on flawed assumptions of the past â€” like the West Indies: The people of the West Indies would certainly not be amused if someone decided to rename their beloved Cricket Team (for example) using a more &quot;correct&quot; term.

I haven't been able to find any proof for this.  But I will give someone a couple of days to provide the proof before I delete this claim from the article -- along with the discussion of what constitutes the &quot;Middle East&quot; (a term that was used neither in Biblical times nor in the 2nd century CE), interesting material but material which belongs in an article on &quot;the middle east&quot; and not her

It says the &quot;lands&quot; that fell within a 1,000 mile radius of Eden were viewed by the Christian Arabs as belonging to the &quot;Cradle of Humanity.&quot; It then says the the countries that TODAY fall within that radius are...X, Y, Z... Regarding the coining of the term, I recommend the following texts: ''&quot;Arab Christians â€” A History of the Middle East,&quot;'' by Kenneth Cragg; and  ''&quot;L'impact de la religion sur l'ordre juridique, cas de lâ€™Ã‰gypte, non-musulmans en pays d'Islam,&quot;'' Ã‰ditions universitaires, Fribourg 1979, XVI-405. Since the term &quot;Cradle of Humanity&quot; is obviously used by some who find the expression Middle East ambiguous (others find it offensive) it makes sense for the article to include sentences which explain WHY those people find the term Middle East ambiguous (or offensive). Or are you suggesting that the term Middle East is not ambiguous (and not offensive) to anyone and therefore no one has the right to use an alternative term? -- David Martindale, NY, USA   <LF>   Since many people today use &quot;Cradle of Humanity&quot; in a very different way than the earlier Christian Arab usage, I think it would be helpful to provide a page citation from the books you mention in the article itself.  As for &quot;the Middle East,&quot; I just think discussion of the term here is unnecessary and irrelevant.  If the term is ambiguous, the solution is not to explain why some people find it ambiguous, the solution is to use a term that isn't ambiguous.  In any event, I myself am not saying the term is ambiguous (although it may be).  For present purposes, the point is that the term is imprecise.  If &quot;Cradle&quot; was used to refer to lands within a circle with a thousand mile radius, provide a map that is in form a circle -- include major geographic features (rivers, mountains) and contemporary political boundaries.  Nothing wrong with this -- and you do not need to use the term &quot;Middle East.&quot;  By the definition given, &quot;Cradle of Humanity&quot; and &quot;Middle East&quot; are simply not isomorphic.

I have edited the headings back to &quot;Evolutionary&quot; and &quot;Evolutionist&quot; because there are many scientists to whom this entire discussion is pointless. Some particle physicists and cosmologists actually consider evolution to be completely &quot;unscientific.&quot; Obviously, their opinion does not make it so, neither does their refusal to accept evolution as a science make them any less scientists in their own field. Hence it would be inaccurate to say, &quot;the Scientific View is this or that,&quot; with regard to material that will be completely rejected by some scientists. Also, saying the &quot;Paleoanthropological View&quot; is not adequate, since it is not only this narrow grouping of scientists that accepts evolution. There is nothing wrong with saying that the non-Creationist view is the &quot;Evolutionary View,&quot; is there? Most scientists that perform the actual research and develop the theories in this constantly changing field of human knowledge are quite prepared to call themselves evolutionists, or evolutionary scientists, since the field involves the cooperation of so many different disciplines. Using any other term would either exclude some of the participants or include scientists who do not participate. -- David Martindale, NY, USA   <LF>

In the case of the Tennessee fainting goat, the goat is medium sized compared to its relatives and neither jumps high nor can climb very strongly.  These goats might seem like they are hurting themselves every time they fall over, but their muscles actually become stronger because of fainting.  Tennessee fainting goats are fascinating creatures that use a defense mechanism that developed because of a combination of recessive genes.  Tennessee Fainting goats (Capra hircus) are often called stiff-leg, nervous, wooden-leg, and scare goat.  This type of goat originated in Tennessee due to a genetic defect that caused these goats to develop myotonia congenita.  Myotonia congenita is a condition that is caused by a combination of recessive genes.  These goats do not actually faint, and myotonia has nothing to do with the goatâ€™s central nervous system.  This condition only affects the goatâ€™s external muscles, which makes the goatâ€™s external leg muscles to become stiff.   Stiffness in the external muscles can lead younger goats to fall over while older goats learn to lock their legs and still stand.  Although these goats might fall over and seem to pass out, myotonia will not harm any internal organs.  The goats remain conscious during the whole experience and will regain mobility to its legs within ten to fifteen seconds after it has fallen down.  The effects of myotonia can also vary due to the intensity of how frighten the goat becomes when it is scared.  The goat is more likely to fall down when the level of fright becomes higher.  The Tennessee fainting goat also uses fainting as a defense mechanism by pretending to be dead.  Because of the myotonia, the Tennessee fainting goatâ€™s muscles have more overall muscle mass than its other relatives.  Tennessee fainting goats become very full and wide because of the increase muscle mass.  This goat is sometimes called meat goats because of the better quality of meat they produce since their muscle contract more often and increase striated muscle because of myotonia.  Other than increasing muscle mass, myotonia serves a purpose to shepherds as well.  Although sometimes fainting does not work to the goatâ€™s advantage, Shepherds keep fainting goats within their flock of sheep to allow the sheep to get away while the fainting goat is sacrificed.  When wolves attack the herd, the fainting goat becomes startled and falls down.  The wolf will go after the goat that is immobile rather than expending energy to chase the sheep.  Other than falling over when scared, the Tennessee fainting goats can also be distinguished from other goats by their bulgy eyes and long erected ears.  Tennessee fainting goats have high reproductive rates and are in heat most of the year, which make them excellent animal to breed.  They are also docile creatures are less prone to escape as oppose to other goats.  They make excellent pets and make a good dinner because of their quality of meat.    <LF>   [[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jimknapp/goats.html]][[http://faintinggoatheaven.com.hosting.domaindirect.com/fainterbreedinfo/breedinfo.html]][[http://www.animalfact.com/article1006.htm]]   <LF>   [[http://www.faintinggoat.com/learnab.htm]]   <LF>

One definition defines animal behavior as, â€œwhat an animal does and how it does it, which encompasses the nonmotor components of behavior as well as an animalâ€™s observable actionsâ€ (Campbell, et al.  1999).  One aspect of animal behavior that will be addressed here is sexuality.  It is important to note that when studying animal behavior, one should always keep in mind the proximate and ultimate causes (how and why behavior exists).   <LF>      <TAB>   Although sexual intercourse seems to be a single act, there are many behaviors leading up to the point.  There are few animals (such as humans) that enjoy copulation simply for pleasure.  For many animals, intercourse is a means of reproduction that can have profound effects on future generations of that animalâ€™s species.  Many behaviors revolving around sexuality involve the selection of the best mate possible.  By doing this, an animal is essentially passing down the best genes to his or her offspring, causing the offspring to be able to compete and survive amongst their peers.  Natural selection is extremely evident in the Animal Kingdom, in which the fight every day leads to the survival of the fittest, and possibly, oneâ€™s own genes surviving for many generations.   <LF>      <TAB>   One important behavior leading to sexual intercourse is the selection of a mate.  Particularly true for humans, facial symmetry (as well as body symmetry) is associated with attractiveness.  Often, symmetry is associated with health, such as in the brush-legged wolf spider, where females rarely choose males with asymmetrical tufts.  It turns out that these males do tend to be smaller and in poorer condition.  Several theories define how females tend to choose mates, generally stating the same idea, that males with ornamentation of certain types are signs of material benefits, health, and good genes.   <LF>   Some females even go so far as to deny copulation until a â€œgiftâ€ has been presented to her liking, such as the black-tipped hangingfly, who will only allow the act to proceed when an edible present is available.     <LF>      <TAB>   Another important behavior that can occur before or after copulation is mate guarding.  Mate guarding is â€œa strategy in which a male attempts to prevent other males from gaining access to a potential or actual mateâ€ (Alcock 2001).  Two strategies of mate guarding include sealing the femaleâ€™s genital closed after copulation and basically staying with the female to ward off other males whose sperm could later be used to fertilize the eggs.  These acts lead to the notions of monogamy and polygamy.  Although it is hard to believe, monogamy is not natural to mammals.  The benefits of monogamy include ensuring that a maleâ€™s sperm is used and helping to rear offspring.  On the other hand, polygamy ensures that a maleâ€™s sperm is spread around enough to potentially produce numerous offspring to subsequent generations.   <LF>      <TAB>   In essence, humans have a fairly simple system of sexuality compared to our fellow animals.  After finding a partner, we live an easy sexual life, so the next time you see a movie about a teenage virgin in agony, think twice about what it would be like to be a member of a wild species!    <LF>   WORKS CITED   <LF>   Alcock, John.

The luxury of having the opposite sex audition for an opportunity to mate is earned through the responsibility of caring for the ensuing offspring.  In the majority of terrestrial animals, the way that the reproductive social structure works is that males compete with each other in order to gain an opportunity to copulate with a female, who is the one that chooses the worthy sex partner.  Once a sexual relationship is attained and the deed is done, the male usually then leaves the female to go off in search of another sexual encounter.  The male need not worry about his progeny because while the male is out, prowling for a new mate, the female stays behind to care for the young.     <LF>   When it comes to marine life, however, the roles between males and females become blurred.  There is far more concern of the males for their offspring.  Some species of fish guard the area where their eggs are kept.  Some species of male fish even go as far as brooding the eggs in their own mouths.  Nonetheless, no fish shows their determination for patriarchal care for their young as much as the seahorse, or class Syngnathidae.  â€œDuring mating, the female transfers eggs into or onto specialized egg-brooding structures that are located on either the male's abdomen or its tail, where they are osmoregulated, aerated, and nourished by specially adapted structures.â€ ([[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12894945&amp;dopt=Abstract]])  This physical and energetic commitment seriously warps any semblance of the idea of the sexual roles of males and females to the point of near perversion.  As it may be concluded from this strange fact, because of this increased attention to offspring on the males behalf over the amount of energy expenditure that the females donate to their young, there must be a resulting role reversal in terms of the social interactions for sexual partner selection.  In fact, for the most part, there is. As the role of parental care is switched from the female to male, so is the mating competition changed from male-male to female-female.  This means that in this reversed situation, the females must compete against one another for an attempt to transfer her eggs into the male.  Here the male is the determining factor in which femaleâ€™s eggs get fertilized.  Accompanying this new set of rules is the change in sexual dimorphism.  â€œTrue to predictionsâ€¦several species are sex-role reversed (e.g., Nerophis ophidion, Stigmatopora nigra, Syngnathus typhle), with females that are more vividly colored and striped than males.â€ ([[http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/pubs/Wilson_etal2003-malebrooding.pdf]])  The pouches of different seahorse species differ in complexity, showing a range of energy investment.  Within this range, as the level of brood pouch complexity, or energy investment, increases, so does the frequency of sex role reversals.    <LF>

The heart or essence of it is &quot;defining each behavior of interest in terms of the behaviors of the same organism    <LF>   surrounding it.&quot; This gives one a self-correcting mechanism in ones approach    <LF>   to understanding -- the most important contribution of classical ethology.    <LF>   Add to it the basic knowledge we have of emotions and emotional development    <LF>   and you can have an outline of a meaningful perspective on learning and meaningful concept of &quot;learning&quot;.   <LF>   An Ethological Conceptualization of Learning:   <LF>   Learning in terms of the interrelated development of basic capacities.   <LF>   Every significant behavior change is now thought to involve learning. Learning and innate aspects of behavioral change are now conceived of as partners in the developmental and adaptational process (Gould and Marler, 1987). They are not even thought to be clearly separable at this point in our understanding of human behavior (Anastasi). Their partnership usually occurs in such an intimate and close time frame that they cannot be contrasted. With regard to the most significant behavior changes, such as stage shifts in cognitive abilities, one cannot see the great extent to which each is involved, and it is impossible to say which is most important: Is whatever &quot;pre-wiring&quot; we have most important or is it what's acquired -- that which involves interaction with the environment and at the same time between our basic &quot;capacities&quot; -- that's most prominent? These are serious questions. And so are the more detailed questions: What is the initial expression of the most important innate action patterns? When do innate action patterns appear? If they are not all present at birth (AND I BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT), how do they manifest themselves as they emerge during ontogeny? AND: What are the basic capacities (if any) that have relatively constant characteristics or similar interrelationships across development? Which types of capabilities most reflect that which is accrued via experience and with development and what is the nature of the changes undergone?   <LF>   Learning, like other topics in psychology, concerns behaviors that have innate and species-specific characteristics. Learning is frequently said to be &quot;constrained by innate factors,&quot; but as far as developmental questions are concerned, it is IN FACT DEFINED in large part by such factors (Johnston, 1981). And, as such, it is involved in all the most significant behavioral changes. Learning as a topic involves the most &quot;microscopic&quot; look at behaviors, in the wider discussion of processes of significant behavior change. Learning may be the most important topic by far, for environmentally-induced behavioral change certainly seems to be key to quality adaptation in all areas of responding.   <LF>   Learning may be defined as changes in those adaptational processes susceptible to experience and due to changes in these processes occurring singly and/or in an interactive manner. There is no pure acquisition (reality does not just progressively impinge itself) and there are no arbitrary acquisitions. Acquisitions must be retained. Clearly there are innate and species-typical processes involved, and fortunately for the human behavioral sciences, general laws to be found.   <LF>   It should not be surprising to find that it is impossible to discuss learning in any detail or with any generality without asking what basic processes are involved in the bit-by-bit behavioral acquisitions which characterize learning. How many types of processes are there and what are their basic natures? I will try to outline what I see as the basic types of processes, their basic character, and which aspects of the processes remain relatively constant and which change systematically, reflecting what in fact has been accrued.   <LF>   First, the organism always has perceptual biases and response biases. These are interrelated and both change significantly during development.* These related processes precede [other] cognition and cognitive processes, including the major aspect of cognitive processing -- representation (to be discussed soon). The proper understanding of these processes (perception and response biases) can come only with proper definition. And, objective definition is obtained only when the environmental and behavioral context in which the important features of these processes occur have been specified. Behaviors (OF THE SAME ORGANISM) preceding and those following a behavior of concern must be identified. This will become more and more important with ontogeny and will be true of the other processes to be discussed as well.   <LF>   In addition to having perceptual biases and response biases, in general, we have memory. Memory at first seems to be of the immediate and may thus be said to have just a short-term aspect. But with experience, the organism interacting in consistent manners with the environment will begin to respond to structure and systematic change in the environment. This shows recognition memory, and soon recall, both characteristics of long-term memory. This capacity, like short-term memory, is limited, BUT INDEPENDENTLY (Brainerd and Kingma, 1985). After some point, &quot;processing space&quot; for short-term memory little influences the processing characteristics of long-term memory, though it is also limited at any given stage of development (the matter of stages to be discussed soon).   <LF>   This is not all that happens. New response characteristics emerge. As structures and occurrences are recognized, new aspects of stimuli are related or are related more consistently (i.e. reacted to in a &quot;different way&quot;). This is not arbitrary. This may be best viewed as determined by new &quot;perceptual biases&quot; and related response biases. The most significant perceptual shifts, I believe, are the first occurrence in, and that which sets into motion, a    <LF>   new developmental stage. Yet this kind of perceptual shift occurs only every so often with regard to any given set of related stimuli to which we respond    <LF>   (Fischer and Pipp, 1984). There are possibly as few as five stages of    <LF>   development in major response areas (Freud, 1965; Ginsburg and Opper, 1978;    <LF>   Jesness, 1985).** How are acquired behavioral adaptations guided in the mean time?   <LF>   At this point we could type different sets of behavior and note the    <LF>   characteristics of their changes, BUT this would violate the standards we have set for objective definition of a behavior-of-concern. We will be better off considering the basic processes we already have and look for further    <LF>   features of these that determine behavior change. One factor has to do with    <LF>   the fact that development of long-term memory takes time. And, the way it develops may show phases. Most important: There are aspects of what we recall    <LF>   that are worth keeping conscious . Consciousness requires response time and    <LF>   uses the scarce resources of short-term memory and much affects other    <LF>   responding. I would say this phenomenon of consciousness occurs for either of   <LF>   two reasons: (1) Further stimuli which are novel or of different varieties    <LF>   must be noted (and possibly, eventually recalled) and these are related to    <LF>   things already remembered (recognized or recalled) OR (2) things to be    <LF>   remembered in much the same WAY as past experiences (already remembered) will    <LF>   be encountered (i.e. similar environmental structures will be encountered    <LF>   (Griffin, 1981)).   <LF>   (Some of (1) and (2) is probably related to the fact that some stimuli impinge on us via less salient sensory modalities or through less salient combinations of modalities. These aspects of stimulation could become conscious later yet may still be related to some basically similar type of relationship we know (and can remember) when it has been found through other    <LF>   modalities.) The aspect of long-term memory of which we are at times able to be conscious is a good broad definition of representation . The nature of    <LF>   representation will change much during development and some of that of which    <LF>   one is conscious as a child will become aspects of awareness or totally    <LF>   automatic in the older child or adult. We still must include these aspects in    <LF>   our understanding of representation. We now need to ask what phases there may    <LF>   be in the development of representation, this important aspect of long-term    <LF>   memory and the most important capacity in significant behavioral change involving experience.   <LF>   First: In a given type of circumstance (or &quot;set of circumstances&quot;) it may    <LF>   take time to usefully retain and represent all the necessary static and    <LF>   dynamic aspects of the situation. To say this in more reductionistic terms:    <LF>   It will take time for all the stimuli of different salience to occur a sufficient number of times, given our perceptual/response biases, and time    <LF>   for them to be responded to consistently . An entire phase of development    <LF>   within every stage could be related to such developments AND, as indicated    <LF>   before, such may well vary in timing somewhat based on the salience of sets    <LF>   of stimuli involved in different circumstances. Second: Next, one's attending    <LF>   (and responding) selectively to certain aspects of immediate situations    <LF>   (ultimately related to perceptual/response biases) eventually may allow one to relate new things separated in space and time. This is another    <LF>   characteristic of memory and retention and eventually of representation. The    <LF>   latter may show two aspects: (1) an ability to imagine sequences of    <LF>   occurrences (the more important ones often involving your own behaviors or    <LF>   potential behaviors) and (2) an ability to see similarities across    <LF>   circumstances (Lucariello and Nelson, 1985). These two reciprocal aspects of    <LF>   memory development and representation can result in there being a second    <LF>   phase during each major stage of cognitive development. This too, for    <LF>   adaptive reasons (and for adaptive purposes), takes time. I do not have the space to speculate on the details here. In any case, all changes in representation will be manifested by systematic alterations in perceptual/response characteristics.   <LF>   Now, finally, I believe one must discuss stages. The processes of memory and perception and the response biases and differences in stimulus salience, all already discussed, cannot (I believe) account for the progressive, hierarchical nature of development (Bowlby, 1982). Development has some invariant stages (descriptively speaking) in which some problems involving representation cannot be understood or cannot be understood reliably. Furthermore, it is just such reliability or consistency which is necessary for the further development of long-term memory processes, including representation. How does one get such consistency, adaptively, AND what is the parsimonious outlook? My answer is that we have stages, defined by new perceptual/response biases, emerging during ontogeny. Such perceptual shifts within an adaptive behavioral complex can have powerful effects indeed, and especially so when it is proposed that the changes in learning also involve progressive memory developments (with phases). The perceptual biases, as indicated before, may differ from one set of related stimuli to another and thus the timing of stages may vary to a degree for different types of    <LF>   responses. It would also seem appropriate to look at this in terms of the    <LF>   timing of aspects of stages. Although what the &quot;sets of related objects&quot; are    <LF>   has not been well delineated and how the timing of developments may vary    <LF>   between them is not clear, there are indications of some common synchronies    <LF>   and some general (overall) stages seem to be defined by these (Corrigan,    <LF>   1983). In any case, the perceptual biases trigger a series of effects, given    <LF>   some of the more consistent characteristics of memory, and these result in a    <LF>   new level of representation and consciousness of new problems. All this    <LF>   allows for another series of developmental changes, such as already    <LF>   described. It should be clear from the outline of ontogeny given above that a    <LF>   general principle applies to learning: Behavioral development involves    <LF>   selective adaptation and eventually consistency of response. A variety of    <LF>   experiences will, in the normal course of adaptation, all be encountered even    <LF>   as consistencies are found.   <LF>   I believe one can point to two aspects of behavior (broadly speaking), spoken    <LF>   of above, that change most in their characteristics during development: (1) the set of perceptual/response biases operative and (2) the elaborateness and    <LF>   precision found in representation. The changes in these capacities are    <LF>   systematically related. A MAJOR CONSISTENCY throughout development seems to exist with respect to short-term memory. While this type of memory may vary with development by 20-30% in quantitative capacity in terms of the number    <LF>   of &quot;chunks&quot; that can be dealt with &quot;deliberately&quot; (increasing with    <LF>   development), this change does not seem tremendously significant (Case et    <LF>   al., 1982; Dempster, 1981). It is clearly not much that's most salient that    <LF>   we can process at one time even late in development. This is especially startling given the large quantitative differences over development in the    <LF>   detail we respond to and in the length of sequences of responses we    <LF>   exhibit. &quot;Quantitative capacity&quot; may be roughly synonymous with what's often    <LF>   viewed as &quot;working memory&quot;, if this is defined as that that we are conscious of in a given situation and at a given moment. But this has little to do with    <LF>   information processing overall. There is always awareness beyond    <LF>   consciousness (in the narrow sense) in significant situations and much    <LF>   processing of long-term memory (some of this related to representation) occurs outside normal awareness.***   <LF>   Other characteristics of memory change in a manner adaptively congruent with    <LF>   changes in perceptual/response biases and with the changing nature of    <LF>   representation during each stage or phase. These changes should have less    <LF>   specific effects on significant learning and should be of a less radical    <LF>   nature. These changes will be definable in terms of the effects they have on    <LF>   responding.   <LF>   FOOTNOTES:   <LF>   * I would say at the outset that I use an unconventional definition    <LF>   of &quot;perceptual biases&quot;, but this would be misleading because I believe that    <LF>   modern conceptualizations of the field of perception are arbitrarily    <LF>   (unsystematically) constrained.   <LF>   **With reference to Piaget's theory, I should note that I consider his 2    <LF>   phases of the Preoperational Period to be stages in the same significant    <LF>   sense as the S-M Period, the C-O Period and the F-O Period are stages.   <LF>   ***Of course psychologists may develop awareness and consciousness of things not normally subject to such through unique and sustained observations.

Using a [[search engine]] can help get information from real ethologists. For the moment, however, I suggest the following. Behavior is action and reaction. Actions are aligned with ''[[Objective (goal)|goals]]'', whether the goals are cognitively derived (thanks to the [[cortex]]) or &quot;natural&quot;. There are some common behaviors across animal species and hence some common goals. Both a human and a [[cat]] stretches and yawns, as do many other animals, however no plant has been observed to [[yawn]] to my knowledge. Perhaps the best way to go about presenting practical information would be to go through the [[evolutionary tree]] and discuss the common behaviors that each animal under [[animalia]] displays; hence, the common goals would also be a point of discussion. It is likely that such discussions will include terms from the biological evolution article and phrases such as &quot;survival of the fit&quot;. If at some point in the tree it looks like a behavior is possessed by an entire [[phyla]], the behavior will be discussed on the page for [[phyla]] instead of being repeatedly included on the individual [[species]] pages. Answering the four questions on the page at the moment seems like a good idea if implemented on each branch of the evolutionary tree. Comments?

The luxury of having the opposite sex audition for an opportunity to mate is earned through the responsibility of caring for the ensuing offspring. In the majority of terrestrial animals, the way that the reproductive social structure works is that males compete with each other in order to gain an opportunity to copulate with a female, who is the one that chooses the worthy sex partner. Once a sexual relationship is attained and the deed is done, the male usually then leaves the female to go off in search of another sexual encounter. The male need not worry about his progeny because while the male is out, prowling for a new mate, the female stays behind to care for the young.   <LF>   When it comes to marine life, however, the roles between males and females become blurred. There is far more concern of the males for their offspring. Some species of fish guard the area where their eggs are kept. Some species of male fish even go as far as brooding the eggs in their own mouths. Nonetheless, no fish shows their determination for patriarchal care for their young as much as the seahorse, or class Syngnathidae. â€œDuring mating, the female transfers eggs into or onto specialized egg-brooding structures that are located on either the male's abdomen or its tail, where they are osmoregulated, aerated, and nourished by specially adapted structures.â€ ([[5]]) This physical and energetic commitment seriously warps any semblance of the idea of the sexual roles of males and females to the point of near perversion. As it may be concluded from this strange fact, because of this increased attention to offspring on the males behalf over the amount of energy expenditure that the females donate to their young, there must be a resulting role reversal in terms of the social interactions for sexual partner selection. In fact, for the most part, there is. As the role of parental care is switched from the female to male, so is the mating competition changed from male-male to female-female. This means that in this reversed situation, the females must compete against one another for an attempt to transfer her eggs into the male. Here the male is the determining factor in which femaleâ€™s eggs get fertilized. Accompanying this new set of rules is the change in sexual dimorphism. â€œTrue to predictionsâ€¦several species are sex-role reversed (e.g., Nerophis ophidion, Stigmatopora nigra, Syngnathus typhle), with females that are more vividly colored and striped than males.â€ ([[6]]) The pouches of different seahorse species differ in complexity, showing a range of energy investment. Within this range, as the level of brood pouch complexity, or energy investment, increases, so does the frequency of sex role reversals.   <LF>   --Wikiconcarne

The heart or essence of it is &quot;defining each behavior of interest in terms of the behaviors of the same organism surrounding it.&quot; This gives one a self-correcting mechanism in ones approach to understanding -- the most important contribution of classical ethology. Add to it the basic knowledge we have of emotions and emotional development and you can have an outline of a meaningful perspective on learning and meaningful concept of &quot;learning&quot;.   <LF>   An Ethological Conceptualization of Learning: Learning in terms of the interrelated development of basic capacities.   <LF>   Every significant behavior change is now thought to involve learning. Learning and innate aspects of behavioral change are now conceived of as partners in the developmental and adaptational process (Gould and Marler, 1987). They are not even thought to be clearly separable at this point in our understanding of human behavior (Anastasi). Their partnership usually occurs in such an intimate and close time frame that they cannot be contrasted. With regard to the most significant behavior changes, such as stage shifts in cognitive abilities, one cannot see the great extent to which each is involved, and it is impossible to say which is most important: Is whatever &quot;pre-wiring&quot; we have most important or is it what's acquired -- that which involves interaction with the environment and at the same time between our basic &quot;capacities&quot; -- that's most prominent? These are serious questions. And so are the more detailed questions: What is the initial expression of the most important innate action patterns? When do innate action patterns appear? If they are not all present at birth (AND I BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT), how do they manifest themselves as they emerge during ontogeny? AND: What are the basic capacities (if any) that have relatively constant characteristics or similar interrelationships across development? Which types of capabilities most reflect that which is accrued via experience and with development and what is the nature of the changes undergone?   <LF>   Learning, like other topics in psychology, concerns behaviors that have innate and species-specific characteristics. Learning is frequently said to be &quot;constrained by innate factors,&quot; but as far as developmental questions are concerned, it is IN FACT DEFINED in large part by such factors (Johnston, 1981). And, as such, it is involved in all the most significant behavioral changes. Learning as a topic involves the most &quot;microscopic&quot; look at behaviors, in the wider discussion of processes of significant behavior change. Learning may be the most important topic by far, for environmentally-induced behavioral change certainly seems to be key to quality adaptation in all areas of responding.   <LF>   Learning may be defined as changes in those adaptational processes susceptible to experience and due to changes in these processes occurring singly and/or in an interactive manner. There is no pure acquisition (reality does not just progressively impinge itself) and there are no arbitrary acquisitions. Acquisitions must be retained. Clearly there are innate and species-typical processes involved, and fortunately for the human behavioral sciences, general laws to be found.   <LF>   It should not be surprising to find that it is impossible to discuss learning in any detail or with any generality without asking what basic processes are involved in the bit-by-bit behavioral acquisitions which characterize learning. How many types of processes are there and what are their basic natures? I will try to outline what I see as the basic types of processes, their basic character, and which aspects of the processes remain relatively constant and which change systematically, reflecting what in fact has been accrued.   <LF>   First, the organism always has perceptual biases and response biases. These are interrelated and both change significantly during development.* These related processes precede [other] cognition and cognitive processes, including the major aspect of cognitive processing -- representation (to be discussed soon). The proper understanding of these processes (perception and response biases) can come only with proper definition. And, objective definition is obtained only when the environmental and behavioral context in which the important features of these processes occur have been specified. Behaviors (OF THE SAME ORGANISM) preceding and those following a behavior of concern must be identified. This will become more and more important with ontogeny and will be true of the other processes to be discussed as well.   <LF>   In addition to having perceptual biases and response biases, in general, we have memory. Memory at first seems to be of the immediate and may thus be said to have just a short-term aspect. But with experience, the organism interacting in consistent manners with the environment will begin to respond to structure and systematic change in the environment. This shows recognition memory, and soon recall, both characteristics of long-term memory. This capacity, like short-term memory, is limited, BUT INDEPENDENTLY (Brainerd and Kingma, 1985). After some point, &quot;processing space&quot; for short-term memory little influences the processing characteristics of long-term memory, though it is also limited at any given stage of development (the matter of stages to be discussed soon).   <LF>   This is not all that happens. New response characteristics emerge. As structures and occurrences are recognized, new aspects of stimuli are related or are related more consistently (i.e. reacted to in a &quot;different way&quot;). This is not arbitrary. This may be best viewed as determined by new &quot;perceptual biases&quot; and related response biases. The most significant perceptual shifts, I believe, are the first occurrence in, and that which sets into motion, a new developmental stage. Yet this kind of perceptual shift occurs only every so often with regard to any given set of related stimuli to which we respond (Fischer and Pipp, 1984).

But it doesn't give the reader any idea of what they have achieved over the years. One example is the NINDS Antiepileptic Drug Development Program, which took up the challenge of developing new anticonvulsants when the drug industry lost interest in the late 1960s. At the time, the US was falling behind Europe wrt epilepsy (and it remains so, in some ways). See [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122250225/HTMLSTART this history] for a brief mention, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119611607/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 this PDF article] for more.

The name ''Strassburg'' already came up during the roman period and is said to come from &quot;''strateburgum''&quot;, a latin form saying nothing else than the german word: street - fort. ThatÂ´s what &quot;my guide book&quot; says! But please check the details - I donÂ´t have it with me! The region is &quot;crawling&quot; with false information - or &quot;omissions&quot; - when it comes to history! The only silver I ever heard of in the region is that of the &quot;Silver Valley&quot; (Val dÂ´Argent, [[Sainte Marie aux Mines]]) about 50 km south west in the Vosges. I do not think it could have been the origin of the name of a place on the river at that time... Strasbourg is not only called &quot;Capitale de lÂ´Europe&quot; but also &quot;Carrefour (crossroads) de lÂ´Europe&quot;. This is still very close to the &quot;obvious&quot; meaning of &quot;Strass(e)-&quot; &quot;Bourgh&quot;. I only know &quot;Strass&quot; (with a short &quot;A&quot;) as the false jewelry sewed on decorated dresses (also in French) - Never heard of it as silver...(?) but maybe this is the origin. In Summer time the municipality regularly organizes a public summer event called the &quot;Nuits de Strass&quot; (Nights in strass) playing with the double meaning. - I am living in the city (part time).[[de:Benutzer:Stephele|Stephele]]   <LF>   Strasbourg is the Parliamentary capital of the EU, and Brussels the Administrative capital. Thus Strasbourg calls itself, rightly IMO, the democratic capital of the EU. Strasbourg is also the capital of Europe as a whole, being the site of the Council of Europe.

[[Brussels, Belgium]] is much more likely to be considered the capital of the [[European Union]] rather than Strasbourg. Both cities are clearly contesting each other for the title &quot;Capital of the EU.&quot; Housing the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council]] (amongst other EU institutions), Brussels houses the most powerful of the 3 decision-making institutions. Most of the Parliament's work is also conducted in Brussels; Strasbourg being only used for the large plenaries which arguably only sign off on the work already done in Brussels. Many in the EU would say that the only reason why Strasbourg is maintained as seat of the EU Parliament is because certain Member States have a vested interest in keeping some activities in Strasbourg. This is evident by the recurring discussions to move all EU Parliament facilities to Brussels rather than maintain a continued and costly transfer of activities between Brussels and Strasbourg once per month. I believe this phrase in this article should acccordingly be removed, revised or at least a disclaimer should be added to make it clear that this isn't a view shared by all EU citizens. (see Brainbridge T. (2002) The Penguin Companion to European Union, p. 32)- [[Kimmetje]]   <LF>   Alba&gt; There is no such thing as one european capital, as everything isn't located in an unique town regarding the EU (neither Strasbourg nor Brussels).   <LF>   European Union had three capitals: Brussels (BE), Luxembourg (LU) and Strasbourg (FR) (Luxembourg for Justice Court. Also houses the administrative office of European Parliament). Page about [[European Parliament]] has a clear explanation about that (see Location paragraph). There won't be a consensus for a few decades and there are countless things that aren't &quot;shared by all EU citizens&quot; (though countless others are shared). -Felipe[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Felipe]   <LF>   this is so cool! you can comment on an online encyclopedia!!   <LF>

The EP in addition has two other working places, in Luxembourg and in Brussels.   No different than millions of other organisations who have a seat in location X, and working locations in many other places.   I dont understand why people constantly try to confuse this very simple issue. I personally think, and many people agree, that it would be very dangerous for the European Union to further centralize and TRANSFER the seat of Strasbourg to Brussels.  Logically, to save money, Parliament should get out of Brussels and only be in Strasbourg (and Luxembourg if necessary but that is not a big problem).   <LF>   :Everybody, including anti-Strasbourg people, agrees the main problem of the EU is its democratic deficit.  How will further centralisation in a city constantly critiqued as the city of &quot;Eurocrats&quot; (unfairly so, I agree, but it is not our fault and that wont change) will help Europe be closer to its citizens???  In addition, I cannot understand how it is possible that the greatest opponents of centralisation in general and of a centralised Europe in particular, or of a European Super State (the British, the Scandinavians, the Liberals, the Greens) are also the ones who want to centralise Europe by transfering the seat of Strasbourg to Brussels?   It is completely contradictory and it is a major blow to their credibility and political honesty.  At the very least, they have some major explaining to do, but they never address that contradiction.  Frankly, I am not surprised ;-).   My opinion is that they are more concerned with short-term issues of personal comfort, than of the building of a strong Europe for decades to come, much beyond their own personal mandates.   <LF>   :Final point, Strasbourg is a well known symbol of political reconciliation between peoples, which is still a very needed concept in today's conflict-ridden world.  Whereas a majority of Flemish-speaking Belgians want to secede from Belgium, thus making Belgium the most probable member of the EU for a future breakup.   How ironic then to want to transfer the European Parliament from the city most symbolic of political reconciliation to the one most symbolic of political disunity?     <LF>   :And if people dont believe me that Strasbourg is STILL a relevant symbol of reconciliation today, then maybe they will believe John Hume, who won the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1998/hume-lecture.html   <LF>

I always tell this story, and I do so because it is so simple yet so profound and so applicable to conflict resolution anywhere in the world. On my first visit to Strasbourg in 1979 as a member of the European Parliament. I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg to Kehl. Strasbourg is in France. Kehl is in Germany. They are very close. I stopped in the middle of the bridge and I meditated. There is Germany. There is France. If I had stood on this bridge 30 years ago after the end of the second world war when 25 million people lay dead across our continent for the second time in this century and if I had said: &quot;Don't worry. In 30 years' time we will all be together in a new Europe, our conflicts and wars will be ended and we will be working together in our common interests&quot;, I would have been sent to a psychiatrist. But it has happened and it is now clear that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution and it is the duty of everyone, particularly those who live in areas of conflict to study how it was done and to apply its principles to their own conflict resolution.&quot;   <LF>

Just as there isnÂ´t ''any'' other language apart from French (no Corsican, no Catalan, no Basque, no Occitan, no Brittannic (?) ...)! - But it (they) should be!! It is not so much because these places once were German (or ruled by (some kind of) Germany) but because that Alsace and big stretches of Moselle are German(+French)-speaking that the German names - and especially the local dialect-forms - should be (and are - no?) mentioned in the articles. In fact ''France'' (the effective majority or the &quot;undynamic&quot; system) does recognize - officialy - that there are other (native - &quot;autochtones&quot;) languages on its territory - but is extremely reluctant to give them an official status. German is officially recognized as the &quot;langue rÃ©gionale&quot; of Haut Rhin, Bas Rhin and Moselle - in its two expressions: &quot;Hochdeutsch&quot; as the written form and the local alsatian and lorrain dialects as (mainly) the spoken form. The &quot;AcadÃ©mie de Strasbourg&quot;, as representing local body of the ministry of education, has to treat German as such - and organise (&quot;prÃ©coce&quot; = early) bilingual education for a growing number of pupils. But thanks to their passivity they did not yet even reach ten% of each yearÂ´s pupils. The regional authorities in Corsica and (French) Basque Country are somewhat more dynamic (- but the number of pupils is lower...). There are a few more things to say about &quot;not being official&quot; in France. Civil servants in Alsace and Moselle get higher pay (until today as far as I know) if they speak German. - Not because they are better qualified but in order to give them recompensation for being potentially obliged to deal with citizens who do not speak proper French but only German (which are of cause quite rare these days)! This is an idea from 1919, when the re-take-over was quiet difficult of course, after nearly fifty years &quot;of Germany&quot; and there was a big need for &quot;fonctionnaires&quot; loyal to the &quot;RÃ©publique&quot; in order to replace the German (or German-educated) civil servants. It was brought back after WWII. In France election candidates have to provide a text presenting them and their program (called the &quot;profession de foi&quot; - like an oath of belief at the church) which is distributed to the voters in their constituency. In Alsace (and Moselle?) this text should be in French and German! Whereas everywhere else in France ''any'' other language is ''forbidden'' on official publications (and sometimes the &quot;prÃ©fets&quot; crack down on such papers!) the authorities in Alsace check if the versions cope - i.e. the German has to be an accurate translation of the French version (or vice versa if you really like), but only about contents - not when it comes to style. The former French secretary of education &quot;Jack&quot; Lang ([[French Socialist Party|PS]]) once said on a trip to Alsace:&quot;German is a very beautyful French language.&quot; Unluckily most French (and especially Alsatian) politicians are much more &quot;frileux&quot; (afraid) to approach the matter that way. I wonÂ´t tell ''you'' how to approach the matter. I come from `GermanyÂ´. I am author in the German and Alemanic Wikipedia (sometimes also the French and exceptionally others) and the problem (in the German one - in Alsatian we do not have this kind of problem!) is working in another way there. - The Wiki is in the language of one version of the cities names! So we have to choose - either the &quot;official&quot; way - or &quot;our&quot; (should-be-official-too) language. There is nothing to choose here. I think, that even if Alsace had a correct satus - as [[South Tyrol]] f.i. - given the (French-Alsatian) situation, the French name should be the ''first'' one (internationally official). And it does no harm, if it is explained. But maybe you can find (consensual) ways of giving the &quot;langue rÃ©gional&quot; some (near-equal) status. Like putting both names (if there are two) in the infoboxes (like it probably should be now in the case of Brittany where biligual name plates for towns are normal now as far as I know). That is just a suggestion. Quarreling about Nations does not help people in Alsace. But they donÂ´t even know that bilinguality (like in Ireland or in Finland, in parts of Canada and Louisiana (?), in Biel/Bienne (Switzerland) or in Brussels) is possible. This is not just a matter of ''politics'' - but of information! Knowing about, and being conscious of bilingualitiy is an aim of education - and should have its place in Wikipedia!   <LF>   :And - without wanting to hurt ''Bismarckians'' - Bismarck was a great asshole! He made the damned guy who personnally spoiled (drowned in blood actually) our first chances of having democracy (of some kind) installed in &quot;Germany&quot; [[William I, German Emperor|emperor]] and he is the culprit responsible of the first separation of Germany, which is still valid - and will ''of course'' remain so...!! :-((  ;-) --[[User:134.176.67.104|134.176.67.104]] 13:23, 22 February 2007 (UTC)[[de:Benutzer:Stephele|Stephele]] from Deutschland - and Elsass   <LF>

Once again, German is NOT a regional language, Alsatian is the regional language and is indeed a Germanic dialect. But hardly anyone in Strasbourg speaks it (it's more common in the countryside). You can't compare Alsace to Canada or Switzerland. Whether you like it or not, people in Alsace feel French and speak French whereas they do not feel German or for the most part speak German. There's no denying that we have Germanic names and all that, but that doesn't really mean anything.

One thing is certain: I have been in Alsace often enough to know about people of your kind, so I know you really might be Alsatian! Luckily not everybody there is like that - and quite some really do speak Alsatian (even in the city) - as I do speaking to them after learning it (by hearing and &quot;doing&quot;) which I found quite easy because: it '''is''' German! Which means I really had to learn it because I come from 400 km downstream from Strasbourg. If I was German from just across the river I would not have needed to learn it - I would have spoken &quot;Alsatian&quot; (or something very similar) as own regional dialect!!! The local dialects of Baden are nearly exactly the same...

To give you an example: try talking to someone in Alsatian in the tram in Strasbourg. Some people might be able to answer you, but everyone will look at you with wide eyes. A few old people still speak Alsatian, but it is (unfortunately, in my opinion) disappearing. The bilinguality programs have not really succeeded in reviving it.   <LF>   I agree that German is a HISTORICAL language of Alsace and that ALsace is culturally Germanic. Even a &quot;supranationalist pro-French Alsatian&quot; like me recognizes that. But today, whether we like it or not, Germanic culture is fading. And young Alsatians don't really care to revive it.   <LF>   FYI the names of streets in historical Strassburg are given in Alsatian (not German) as well as French.   <LF>   So while there's no denying that Alsace is Germanic in some respects, I think emphasizing bilinguality is pointless because local people (at least young people) don't really care and feel fully French (and for the most part speak fairly mediocre German and no Alsatian).    <LF>   Also, I'm not a &quot;surnationaliste&quot; or anti-German or anything of the sort. I fully understand that Alsace has a strong Germanic heritage and I believe that discussions on what Alsace &quot;really&quot; is are absurd. Alsace will be both French and Germanic at least for several more decades. But today, the trend is definitely towards being French and keeping Germany as a part of the region's history and an influence on its culture, which is why I feel emphasizing the German side of ALsace makes little sense.   <LF>   PS: don't say that Alsatian is German. While I partly agree with you, I know that it would be insulting to some people who pride themselves on their regional identity;   <LF>

Restez poli quand mÃªme, Monsieur!! :-))) OK, all right! - You are not French enough to keep polite - and you donÂ´t want to discuss a bit more &quot;to the point&quot;... In fact I do not even understand what you want from me with your teachings about &quot;German feelings&quot; and &quot;French feelings&quot;! Did I write anything about such things? - Oh, I was trying to calm down the &quot;pro-German&quot; activities of some American wikipedian - but did I say anything about &quot;feelings&quot; in that context?. So I am not sure who is ''at the side'' of the &quot;plaque&quot; and who`s ''on'' - and what kind of &quot;plaque&quot; you are talking about. But if you are on it, then I am glad, IÂ´m not!!   <LF>   :Some more things made me wonder if you really know what you are talking about! Like: &quot;''But hardly anyone in Strasbourg speaks it (it's more common in the countryside)''&quot;... We are still speaking about Alsace here, arenÂ´t we? Are you sure you donÂ´t mean [[Brittany]] (and [[Breton language|Breton]]) or [[Provence]] (and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])?? Whatever - I cannot leave all this rubbish unanswered, starting with the central piece-of-nonsense: &quot;''don't say that Alsatian is German - it would be insulting to some people''&quot;! - Well... that's sad! But: truth hurts, sometimes!    <LF>   :It is &quot;Germanic&quot;, you say? - A &quot;[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]&quot; Dialect? - You mean &quot;Germanic&quot; like [[Faroese language|FarÃ¶isk]]... or [[Old Norse|old]] [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]?? &quot;FYI&quot;: I do speak French! - And I know the word &quot;''germanique''&quot; and its meaning helping to differentiate among things nationally and culturally &quot;German&quot; (deutsch). I of course learnt it after the first (natural) misunderstandings because (as in French when it comes to things described by the word &quot;franÃ§ais&quot;) there is no such differentiation about the word &quot;deutsch&quot; in the German language. But I must remind you of one thing: we are talking ''English'' here, not French! &quot;[[Germanic Europe|Germanic]]&quot; in English does not have this same connotation, the same meaning altogether as &quot;germanique&quot; (French)! And your strange attempt to import the French meaning of this word into English makes obvious the difficulty of this way of speaking even in French: it establishes the idea that there is a division between Alsatian and German, that there is another distinction between the two than the &quot;national&quot; one. I, as a native speaker of German ([[Standard German|Hochdeutsch]]), and still a person used to a number of ''German'' dialects from [[Sprachraum|in- and outside Germany]], or - as you prefer - &quot;Germanic&quot; dialects, or to say it really clearly: [[High German languages|dialects]] of the [[German language]], can tell you that there is... '''none'''!! It seems you have absolutely no idea what this is: a [[dialect]]. It is a form of - mainly oral - language, in most cases spoken in geographically limited areas, that is part of a group of similars most commonly linked to a more widespread form which is often ''normalised'' (by rules) and officialised - as the German language and its regional &quot;''Mundarten''&quot; (&quot;mouth kinds&quot;).    <LF>   :There is no linguistic division between Alsatian and the neighbouring dialects of German - if they are from Germany or Switzerland or France (Moselle) or Luxembourg (apart from the distinction of the Upper Alemanic, Lower Alemanic and Franconian groups)!! Anybody who says different does this for political (IÂ´d suggest nationalist) reasons! And the feelings of some people - feelings that have nothing to do with the facts! - cannot keep me from saying the truth! (Anyway I prefer to think of the feelings of those Alsatians who are fed up with the lies!)   <LF>   :OK, you are Alsatian - and I am &quot;German&quot; (Deutscher)... So you got to know...- many will probably think. But do you speak German? - A little bit from school, I suppose? And do you speak Alsatian? No (it seems...)? - Well, I do! As I already said above I learnt it, and I know that if I was coming from (''originaire de'') directly east of Strasbourg (which means of course in Germany) my own regional (German AND &quot;Germanic&quot;) dialect would be, for you, not distinguishable from Alsatian! - Once again a clear statement that did not keep you from writing down more ''aberrations'' without finding a single direct argument against me. And with whom do I speak Alsatian (I am '''not''' speaking it in monologues!)? - It is funny, you mention the tram! One out of, let's say, five times I take the Strasbourg-tram (or buses) I hear people speaking Alsatian (mostly &quot;'''Strosburjerditsch'''&quot; - the local version, so they are '''not from the countryside'''... Ah, and yes! It is called &quot;Strossburjer'''ditsch'''&quot; - ''Strassburgerdeutsch'' (!!) - Strasbourg ''German'' )!    <LF>   :But why would I speak to them? Why should I just walk up to someone and start &quot;''babble''&quot;? Whenever I go to shops though, I often try to speak Alsatian to the shop assistants (because I find it absolutely '''boring''' to speak French all the time - and thus use only one of the options and anyway it is quite unnatural that people of a (the same) &quot;germanique&quot; mothertongue would chose another language in order to communicate, ''n'est-ce pas''? Especially as I have learned the regional version! - There are sometimes strange reactions but... no &quot;bewildered looks&quot;! It gets even better! A few weeks ago the city opened up the new and extended tram lines. There was a kind of huge festival on wheels when the population tried out the new lines for free. On five consecutive trams I took I could hear (different) people speak Alsatian! I did not even expect it to be like that - I am not always that &quot;lucky&quot;! In the sixth tram there were two old ladies sitting down opposite of me and I heard them complain (in Alsatian, if I still need to stress) that they preferred sitting in driving direction. So I offered them my seat (in Alsatian...). No &quot;wide eyes&quot;, neither from them nor from &quot;everyone looking at me&quot;! Just the expression of pleased surprise that I did not only speak &quot;their tongue&quot; but that I had even got their conversation. Well they were ''old''... some of the &quot;''few old people''&quot; who &quot;''still speak Alsatian''&quot;... ''A few'' you say?? - Well, if you call about 90% (of the elderly) &quot;a few&quot;... (even in the city!). You say that it is  disappearing - &quot;''unfortunately'' in your opinion&quot; - If you regret this, then why do you yourself make it disappear in your mind? Why do you pretend itÂ´s a kind of &quot;natural&quot; development and why do you declare any attempt of &quot;resisting&quot; the process useless? - You say: &quot;''the bilinguality programs have not really succeeded in reviving it''&quot;?? - What &quot;bilinguality programs&quot;? What are you talking about? I can only try to guess what you mean - but ''that'' is not made to succeed, itÂ´s not meant to succeed! There are no &quot;bilinguality programs&quot; in France! - There are only some exceptions of the huge national(ist) &quot;monolinguality program&quot;!!!   <LF>   :Do you mean the street signs? You think you are giving me &quot;''nouvelles''&quot; by this:   <LF>   ''FYI the names of streets in historical Strassburg are given in Alsatian (not German) as well as French.''   <LF>   :Yes - and why is that? Because there are some people with influence around, who think like you: &quot;Alsatian is not German&quot;! - So street signs cannot be in the &quot;official form&quot; of Alsatian... But I am absolutely &quot;pro&quot;! I like street signs in the local form of German! - ThatÂ´s &quot;closer to the roots&quot;. Would be nice though if these street signs were as official as they look! - And not only the French(speaking) ones!!   <LF>   :But the '''main''' reason for the decline of FranceÂ´s ''langues rÃ©gionales'' is not even the policy of &quot;''Madame la RÃ©publique''&quot;. - It is the attitude of ''the'' people, it is '''your attitude''', your strange kind of '''total ignorance''' (concerning your own home place!) that is making the damage!!! Because that is the point: the &quot;wide eyes&quot; - or whatever strange reactions there might be, when someone speaks Alsatian in public - is not because people think you are from space - or Germany. It is because they have been trained (mostly) for all of their life that ''it'' - their very own beloved (mother-)&quot;tongue&quot; - is not worthy being heard by other people, that it is &quot;unofficial&quot;! - That it is a &quot;''[[patois]]''&quot;. So speaking oneÂ´s own language gets a matter of trust or confidence. Never heard of the Occitans who never speak their language but to their closest relatives? (And maybe one or two of their Boule-companions...)   <LF>   ''I agree that German is a HISTORICAL language of Alsace''    <LF>   :As long as Alsatian is the language of Alsatians, German is NOT ''historical''.   <LF>   ''and that ALsace is culturally Germanic.''   <LF>   :''Germanic''??

I am sorry to get to this conclusion, but it seems that, as other Germans, you take great pleasure to insist on the fact that elderly [[Alsatian]] people speak, along with French, the Alsatian dialect, which is an Alemanic dialect similar to the Swiss-German, etc., and with that you consider that the whole part of the inhabitants of Alsace still speak German today, which is not true. Only senior people are able - today - to speak fluently in German (because of WW2). But they do not. They speak the dialect. What for the young people? Only about 25% are able to speak the dialect. Those who speak dialect cannot speak fluent German. The majority of the young people cannot speak the dialect, and could only speak bad school-learnt German. These are facts. You wonder why the Alsatians insist on saying they speak the dialect, not German? Well, you might agree that if what became the Reichsland had not been annexed to Germany (in 1871, 25% of the Alsatian people understood French, thanks to school and to the military service), the fate of Alsace would have been similar to the one of the other French regions - where progressively everybody became able to speak French. As a consequence, while in 1919 less than 1/4 of the Alsatian people could speak French, the situation would have been quite different (without the annexation), with 100% of the Alsatian inhabitants speaking French in 1919. Once again, these are facts. You probably know that, when the Alsatian people were 'evacuated' to South-western France in Sept. 1939, they were regarded as German people by their fellow French citizens from there... Nicknamed &quot;ya-yas&quot; (Ja ja!), etc... because only a few of them could speak French? Not quite funny at all. You wonder why the Alsatian 'elite' and most of the inhabitants (the big majority of the Alsatians) don't want to deal with the German languange anymore? You don't have any clue? Maybe the name of Robert Backfisch, and his fellow dignitaries' dictatorship, murders, damages, could help...?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

A very romantic place indeed, additionally blessed by ignorance of the place's beauty among English speakers (unlike Heidelberg which was swarming with the latter). However, on the boat trip there were two parts of the city's history which escaped me (due to an elderly man next to me unpluging my headphone by mistake). The first and most interesting for me is the story about the Irish monks. Where can I find out more about the Irish monks and school which were based in the city along the Lille? The second is the story about 20 or so people who perished because some fat guy got stuck in a window during an escape and nobody could get passed him. That building is a large one next to where the above monks lived. Does anybody know more about any of these two? Thanks a millio

In 1919 about all inhabitants of the region were German citizens. After nearly 50 years as a part of the German Empire most of them were born Germans. The French authorities expelled mostly those, who had only ancestors from other parts of Germany or had immigrated themselves after 1870. Many were allowed back to Alsace later, if they wanted. In fact the whole population was classified in a &quot;A-B-C-D&quot;-system according to their ancestry. Quite frightening!

After the occupation of the &quot;Three Bishoprics&quot; Metz, Toul and Verdun, the French king Henri II advances up to the gates of Strassburg. But then the city was still able to defend itself and determined to do it. The burghers brought their artillery in position onto the ramparts - the gun named &quot;Gro@e Meise&quot; (great titmouse) gave the Strassburgrs their nickname of &quot;Meiselocker&quot; (titmouse enticers) - and refuse the demands of the French army for food supplies. The invading troups have to retreat, they have no support in the country.    <LF>   The city state can still defend itself against a territorial state.   <LF>   This was not the first incursion by the French. They began in 1365 led by a knight, then came the one of 1444 led by the futur LouisXI , who too was forced back, and even then asking the Strassburgers if they did not want to come under French.protection The stinging answer of the city was: &quot;Never! As they (the French) have no character and truthfulness, make many promises, document and seal a lot, but never keep their word.&quot; The end of the free city,1681   <LF>   &quot;Es verbleibet Alles im alten Stande&quot; [Everything remains as it    <LF>   was] wrote the Ammeister Franziskus Reissessen into his diary or    <LF>   &quot;Memorial&quot;, at the end of his short account of the capitulation of    <LF>   Strassburg. That was the illusion the negotiators gave themselves up    <LF>   to.   <LF>   But nothing remained as it was, Louis XIV and his minister Louvois    <LF>   did not have the intention, to keep the promisses made. It did not last ten years and almost nothing remained from the promissed liberty.   <LF>   The emasculation of the city regime's power   <LF>   As a free city, Strassburg did not have a foreign garrison in its    <LF>   walls. Now the military governor, M. de Chamilly, with the support of a garrison of many thousand men, could give every wish of the king the    <LF>   necessary emphasis. It was of equal importance that the intendant,    <LF>   Jacques de la Grange, transferred at once his seat of office to    <LF>   Strassburg.   <LF>   Not six weeks after the capitulation, on the 9th. of November 1681,    <LF>   these two representatives of the king appeared at the meeting of the    <LF>   &quot;Herren RÃ¤t und Einundzwanzig&quot; [the honorable councillors and    <LF>   Twenty-one], followed by the city-sollicitor Johann GÃ¼ntzer, who had    <LF>   already played a role during the capitulation negotiations. They let it be known that a royal edict made this GÃ¼ntzer a &quot;royal Syndic&quot; [this    <LF>   was a reward for his treason]. Although he did not have a seat and vote in the council, he, as chief of the city's chancellory, had knowledge    <LF>   of all happenings and negotations and could report to his masters in    <LF>   detail.   <LF>   Less than four years later, the jurist Ulrich Obrecht, who had just    <LF>   converted to catholicism, was promoted to &quot;Royal praetor&quot; and was thus    <LF>   &quot;Stettmeister&quot; for life. With the word &quot;praetor&quot; the French designated    <LF>   the Stettmeisters who, together with the Ammmeister governed the city.    <LF>   He had a seat and vote in the council and against his will no decision    <LF>   could be made. He was the eye and ear of the king in the city, although the old city constitution still existed up to the revolution. The    <LF>   councillors were elected and the Oath read in front of the cathedral,    <LF>   but the true head of the city was the praetor. Almost nothing remained    <LF>   of the guaranteed autonomous administration. Here too, the comparison    <LF>   with the way the autonomous administration of Alsace-Lorraine was    <LF>   dismantled step by step after 1918 cannot be rejected out of hand.   <LF>   Even the election, as irrelevant they had become, were not free    <LF>   anymore. 1687 the praetor Obrecht brought a new demand of the king: the composition of the coucil should reflect the confessional composition    <LF>   of the population. As pretext served an article of the treaty of    <LF>   Westphalia which ruled a mixed filling of positions in certain    <LF>   administrations. Obrecht, however, made the &quot;Alternative&quot; out of the    <LF>   proportionality, that is, that for each leaving protestant councillor a catholic would have to be elected and vice versa, so that in a short    <LF>   time the council had parity, thus having an equal number of both    <LF>   confessions.   <LF>   The restriction of the religious freedom   <LF>   This hit the citizen even harder than the restriction of the    <LF>   political freedom [today the language has taken the place of religion]. 1681 one counted only two catholic families among the 20 000 odd    <LF>   inhabitants. 16 years later there were already almost 750 families.   <LF>   The conservation of the protestant character of the city had been    <LF>   the main concern of the negotiators of 1681, in this too they did not    <LF>   succeed. The re-catholisation, which had made so great advances out in    <LF>   the countryside, began at once in the city. Jesuits and capuchin monks    <LF>   could work without hindrance, conversely it was forbidden to the    <LF>   protestant pastors, to baptize mixed marriage children or to receive    <LF>   again in their congregation a citizen who had converted to catholicism. To this came sizeable material incentives, who converted was freed from billeting of soldiers and free of taxes for three years and sometimes    <LF>   got a gift of money, a pension of 100 or 200 Livres.   <LF>   The abrogation of the edict of Nantes 1685 which had as consequence    <LF>   the mass-emigration of the French Huguenots, was not applied in Alsace, but the catholic propaganda increased. Whole villages like    <LF>   Illwickersheim (Ostwald today) or Herrlisheim converted, the pastors    <LF>   were chased out or imprisonned.   <LF>   Who wanted to be well thought of &quot;above&quot;, had to convert. French and catholic was more or less equated. The most important converted in    <LF>   Strassburg was the praetor Obrecht. During a stay in Paris in 1684 no    <LF>   one less than Bossuet instructed and baptized him. Reissessen remarks    <LF>   to this in his diary:&quot;Es hat derselbige, pro dolor, die Religion    <LF>   changiert&quot; [The same one has, pro dolor, changed his religion]. A few    <LF>   months later GÃ¼ntzer, the royal syndic,  followed in his footsteps.    <LF>   How Obrecht was rewarded was already stated. Their wives, however,    <LF>   remarkably did not follow suit, which was not liked &quot;above&quot;.   <LF>   What it cost to resist the king's order, the Ammeister Dominikus    <LF>   Dietrich had to learn the hard way. The king wanted to force the    <LF>   conversion of this man by all means, for he was the most respected man    <LF>   in the whole city, as he hoped that his example would produce many more conversions. He was ordered to Versailles in 1685 and held there for    <LF>   five months; as he steadfastly stuck to his religion, he was banned to    <LF>   Gueeeret, divested of all his official positions and was &quot;to be kept    <LF>   for dead&quot;, as Louvois expressed it. Only in 1689 was he allowed back to his city, under the condition not to leave his house and only to    <LF>   receive visits from his family. He died five years later.   <LF>   The alternative made it possible for newly converted to have at once access to city administrative positions; 1688 there are already one    <LF>   catholic Stettmeister and two councillors, although, as Reissessen    <LF>   writes, there were not 30 citizens of this confession. 1694 15    <LF>   catholics sit in the Magistrate. Who wanted to hold court for the new    <LF>   masters had to convert. The characterlessness imputed, often not    <LF>   without reason, to the Alsatians had its start then; the families    <LF>   Turncoat are always more numerous than the families Steadfast.   <LF>   Does Louis XIV renounce Strassburg?   <LF>   Suddenly everything is put into question again. The situation in    <LF>   Europe had changed. The Turks had been beaten decisively before Vienna    <LF>   (1683). Under the generals Karl of Lorraine and Eugene of Savoy the    <LF>   Austrians conquered Hungary from the Turks; in England the &quot;glorious    <LF>   revolution&quot; had chased the Stuarts away and with William of Orange    <LF>   brought the greatest and most competent enemy of Louis XIV on the    <LF>   throne. The war of succession of the Palatinate (in the French    <LF>   history-books it is called the war of the Augsburg Ligue) brought at    <LF>   first the laying waste of the Palatinate and the destruction of the    <LF>   castle at Heidelberg [among others], then a serie of French defeats, so that the French king had to condescend to negotiations. 1696 he offered even the return of either Luxemburg or Strassburg. If the imperial    <LF>   negotiators had acted fast, they could have received Strassburg, but    <LF>   they demanded both and drew out the negotiations. In the meanwhile the    <LF>   French negotiators succeeded to make separate peace-treaties with    <LF>   England, Holland and Spain, so that the emperor had to be satisfied    <LF>   with lesser conditions.   <LF>   The peace treaty of Ryswick (1687) laid down for the first time the    <LF>   Rhine as frontier of Alsace. France renounced all its conquests on the    <LF>   right side of the river, among them Kehl. The emperor recognized all    <LF>   French annexations since he treaty of Nymwegen:   <LF>   &quot;His sacred imperial majesty cedes to the sacred very christian    <LF>   majesty (The king of France) the city of Strassburg and everything that belongs to it on the left side of the Rhine, with all rights, property    <LF>   and sovereignty...&quot; it says in article 16 of the treaty.   <LF>   &quot;The city of Strassburg was ceded to the crown of France, writes    <LF>   Reissessen, and without some reservations&quot;. The Colmar chronicler notes for his part:   <LF>   &quot;It is hard for us, that we, who had been a free imperial estate,    <LF>   are now slaves of a foreign power. We have publiquely sung the &quot;Te    <LF>   Deum&quot; for the peace, but at home we sang &quot;On the waters of Babylon&quot;    <LF>   (The mourning song of the jews in exile there).   <LF>   The big powers had decided over the whole of Alsace without asking    <LF>   its inhabitants [as was to happen repeatedly later on].   <LF>   The emigration   <LF>   The article 17 of the peace of Ryswick, which follows the cessions    <LF>   paragraph 16, contains the remarkable rule:   <LF>   &quot;Nevertheless all and sundry inhabitants of the said city, of which    <LF>   condition they ever are, who would like to withdraw, transfer their    <LF>   domicile somewhere else, with all their movables, without any hindrance nor deduction whatsoever, , will be free to do so within one year&quot;.   <LF>   This article points out the emigration which had already begun in    <LF>   1681 after the capitulation of Strassburg, and which, now that hope for a return of the former situation had dwindled, began anew. There had    <LF>   already been secret protests against the new regime. As Louis XIV    <LF>   violated omce more the capitulation and took away from the city the    <LF>   right to coin money in 1693, a number of gold-guilders was coined in    <LF>   the Strassburg mint with the picture of the king but instead of the    <LF>   inscription &quot;LUD&quot;(ovicus) REX&quot; &quot;IUD (as) REX&quot; was used, king Judas, the traitor. Such coins are sought after by collectors today.   <LF>   Who did not want to bend before the new rulers, had only emigration    <LF>   left. This emigration of the Strassburgers and Alsatians has drawn    <LF>   little attention up to now. It is difficult to get details of it.    <LF>   Reissessen remarked: &quot;The most notable families make mien to leave from here&quot;. The emigration had already begun in 1681, as mentioned, and    <LF>   mainly after 1685 (the abrogation of the Edict of Nantes). Then there    <LF>   was talk of mass-running-away and how one could stop it.   <LF>   The praetor Obrecht, washed with all waters, found here too an    <LF>   illegal way out. Following his suggestion, Louvois wrote to the Council that all would-be emigrants were to be taxed with an extraordinary levy of 10% on their holdings . This was illegal, the citizens had the right to leave freely. Obrecht's argument was that the city had a large debt    <LF>   and, if one let the emigrant go freely, those who remained had to pay    <LF>   the more, that it was not a tax but a contribution to the service of    <LF>   the debt. The Council resisted for a long time, but had to give in in    <LF>   1687. The same year it had to accept the &quot;Alternative&quot;. It just was not independent in its decisions anymore. Despite the clear wording of the    <LF>   peace of Ryswick, the contribution went on to be levied on the demand    <LF>   of Louvois and Obrecht. Their main aim was to stop the emigration.   <LF>   How big it was cannot be known. The registers of the &quot;Stallherren&quot;    <LF>   [stable masters], as the Strassburg tax office was known then and in    <LF>   which the names of the emigrants had been noted, have disappeared. Some names are mentioned in the protocols of the Council, others can be    <LF>   found in the citizen-books of the cities which received them; there    <LF>   were mainly the southern German imperial free cities of Frankfurt,    <LF>   Heilbronn, Esslingen, Ulm, NÃ¼rnberg, also Stuttgart, which was not a    <LF>   free city. The handed down history sets the number at 300 families.    <LF>   This was not quite 10% of the city's population. From the records of    <LF>   Frankfurt and other cities it can be surmissed that there were rather    <LF>   more. Two waves can be distinctly discerned, one after 1685 the other    <LF>   after 1697. While before single persons, mostly tradesmen, gave up    <LF>   their citizenship, there are now whole families with women and    <LF>   children.   <LF>   Among the immigrants all ways of life are represented, not only the    <LF>   &quot;notable families&quot;. Some are very wealthy, the merchant Johann Daniel    <LF>   Franck, who absconds 1686 already, declares a fortune of 51 300    <LF>   Guilders, his son, who follows him in 1698, declares 46 000 Guilders.    <LF>   In the same year also, Josias StÃ¤del moves &quot;with sack and pack to    <LF>   Frankfurt&quot;; one of his descendants funded the famous StÃ¤del    <LF>   Art-Institute in Frankfurt. The city-advocate went 1682 already to    <LF>   Vienna where he achieved a high position, and the law-consultant    <LF>   Dr.Stoesser left in 1686 for Brandenburg. According to a calculation    <LF>   from the year 1699 the paid or still owed contributions amounted to 34    <LF>   614 Guilders, which corresponds to a capital of 350 000 Guilders, an    <LF>   enormous sum for the time which is certainly distributed over many    <LF>   hundred families.   <LF>   The emigration was not only quantitatively important, but also    <LF>   qualitatively. It is a known fact that the emigrants belong to the most competent and energetic people. The distinguished positions which they    <LF>   attained in their new homelands, like also the Huguenots driven out at    <LF>   the same time, attest to the truth of this rule. Besides the Strassburg emigrants, one finds others from the protestant territories in the    <LF>   files, the territory of LÃ¼tzelstein, for example.   <LF>   This emigration is the first big bloodletting which followed a    <LF>   change of rule in Alsace, it was repeated many times: 1793, less in 1870; 1918, 1945.   <LF>   If the emigrants in their new homes gave a reason, it was always the religion, the maintenance of the evangelical belief. This secured them    <LF>   tax-advantages and an easier acquisition of citizenship in the    <LF>   protestant free imperial cities. However, it would be wrong to conclude that this was only a pretext. We have seen that the religious pressure    <LF>   was felt especially hard; the freedom of religion had been the decisive point in the capitulation. National sentiment in todays sense cannot be imputed to the exiles, there was neither a German nor a French &quot;Nation&quot; as we understand them today [This was to become an invention of the    <LF>   French revolution]. On the other hand the religious and political    <LF>   motives cannot be separated. Catholic and French, better royal, were    <LF>   for many synonymous. The emigration was also certainly a protest    <LF>   against the loss of the imperial city's freedoms and against the    <LF>   submission to a foreign arbitrary rule. This is reflected in the remark of the Colmar chronicler: we are now slaves of a foreign power.    <LF>   In Alsace one is today only too much inclined to project opinions    <LF>   and emotions of today into the past, to equate the state of then with    <LF>   the one of today. One thus falls into anachronism, the sin against the    <LF>   spirit of history. Jubilees are especially strong temptations for this    <LF>   sin. But they should be the incentive to remember the past, how it had    <LF>   been, and the values which it is necessary to retain.   <LF>   [In this context it would be interesting to compare the actions of    <LF>   the French in the Saar-Territory after 1918 and 1945 with their actions in Strassburg 300 years ago - There are many parallels]''   <LF>

Of course there's no doubt that throughout its history Strasbourg was quite important to the mutual relationship of France and Germany in many aspects, but was it really a bridge for Latin and Germanic culture? That's just a terrible thing to say since these &quot;cultures&quot; never played a role in the franco-german relationship. France and Germany aren't parts of two essentially different cultural spheres, despite of all historical differences. They are both influenced by the Roman empire, they are both parts of the former Frankish Kingdom, they are both Western European countries and combine Latin with Germanic traits, and while French is a Romance and German is a Germanic language, it's just laughable to confuse this linguistic difference with a cultural one. Germany, presented as an representative of this ominous Germanic culture, has historically got much more in common with &quot;Latin&quot; France than with Norway, for example. Germanic and Latin Europe are nothing but two foggy, ahistorical concepts based solely on a linguistic difference, and aren't worthy to be used in this article, especially when one considers that Strasbourg is already characterised as a ''&quot;bridge of unity between modern France and Germany&quot;'' in the sentence before.   <LF>   Greeting

Is at this time that the word started to spread and some new signification appeared like Bourgeois ( the man from the Bourg/burg) and that numerous towns in Germany and France stated to bear the word Bourg in the name of the town ( Cherbourg, Lanslebourg, Bourg en Bresse, Strasbourg, Lauterbourg Cabourg, Luxembourg, Lunenburg, Hamburg etc.... Anyway, still now scientists are still arguing its possible origin, but it seems attested that the Roland song was really on the point to spread the word thoughout western and mittel Europa. I guess the word &quot; borough&quot; might be an &quot;anglicisation&quot; of the term.... Another mystery to resolve https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourg if you can read French

The point I was making three or four years ago was that someone had naÃ¯vely added the words &quot;from Greek Ï€ÏÏÎ³Î¿Ï‚&quot; to the etymology. Now the element &quot;burg&quot; and its variants exist in a wide range of Germanic languages and there is no reason to suppose that they got there from Greek.   <LF>   :::Looking at this from a neutral point of view â€“ I am English-born, but lived for some years in France and have studied Romance linguistics â€“ I am inclined to the view that you have been reading some rather francocentric etymologists. I see no evidence of &quot;burgus&quot; in Classical Latin and it seems most likely that it got into Late Latin as a result of the Germanic migrations of the fifth century. The word exists in Old English as &quot;burg&quot; or &quot;burh&quot; and occurs as an element in numerous place names. For example, the name of the city of Salisbury in Wiltshire is attested over 100 years before the Song of Roland is thought to have been composed and even longer before its widespread popularity. The spelling &quot;borough&quot; is rather fanciful. We actually say /bÊŒrÉ™/.   <LF>   :::The origin of the name of Strasbourg is clearly Germanic. The city was very much a part of Germany throughout the Middle Ages and became part of France in 1681. Since then it has changed hands several times and when I lived there about 55 years ago the principal language of the city was Alsatian, an Allemanic variety of Upper German. Since then French has taken over almost completely. I have seen something similar happening with Brussels during my lifetime. It is still officially bilingual, but has become overwhelmingly French-speaking. Years ago we used to reckon it was approx. 80% French-speaking and 20% Dutch-speaking. (&quot;Flemish&quot; is just the Belgian name for Dutch â€“ in both Belgium and the Netherlands it is officially called &quot;Nederlands&quot;

I just sum up some info trying to talk about the origin of the terminology of Bourg/burg. I never made a comment about Strabourg precisely. Furthermore I never said that the word was French, even more surprising, I never talked about Stasbourg as having French name origin. I recall giving city names from France and Germany like Lunenburg or Hamburg to illustrate the spread on the use in both countries. I never stated from which side it definitely came from. I just said that it is probably during the Charlemagne era that the terminology spread (and as far as I'm concerned, back then France nor Germany didn't exist), I never said neither that it was the starting point to the word, and that cities would start to adopt the term all of a sudden (the Roland Song mentioned the term so, it existed prior of the song, I took this fact for obvious.).... I said or I meant if you prefer, that it was one of the first time that the term was specified, and the notoriety of this song was probably a vector to increase the spread. What the heck the French speaking evolution of Bruxelles is related to the origin and use on Bourg/burg? I end my edit saying that the mystery is still to find.  And for the history of Alsace (since you open your comment by your place of origin), being Alsatian by my mother, and my family being traced back to the 13th century around Surbourg, I really don't need a refresh of the history of the region. And for your comment about Strabourg being part of &quot;Germany&quot; during the middle age, I'm sure that you are aware that it is a little bit more complex (eg the proclamation in Versailles in 1871). Furthermore during the middle age, the Holy Roman Empire, was spread up to some parts of Italy, Savoie, Burgundy, eastern Belgium and many region in Central Europe. So it is not as simple as you say. But I'm surprised, at first I candidly thought that the question was just about a discussion about the origin of the terminology Bourg/burg. But thank you for your &quot;neutral point of view&quot;

I am sorry if I misunderstood your previous post. I was originally commenting specifically on the element &quot;-bourg&quot; in the name of the city of Strasbourg. It seemed naÃ¯ve to attribute a Greek origin to this when the element was so widespread in Germanic languages. When I used the expression &quot;part of Germany&quot;, I meant that it was in that part of the Holy Roman Empire which was known as the Kingdom of Germany and in the area which was linguistically and culturally German.   <LF>   :I looked at the article in French WP about the word &quot;bourg&quot; and I see that the Greek origin theory is not widely held, although I would be happy with the notion that the Greek word could be cognate with the Germanic word.    <LF>   :As for Brussels, I merely mentioned it in passing, because during my lifetime I have seen an advance in the use of French in both Strasbourg and Brussels. French is continuing to expand, just as English is advancing in parts of the British Isles where it was very much a second language until relatively recently.

J'ai eu de grosses envolÃ©es  Ã©galement sur l'article sur la langue Allemande sur la page de discussion anglaise. Ou il semble qu'une collection de drapeau de pays est plus important que la rÃ©alitÃ©. Par exemple insister pour faire figurer la slovaquie dans l'info box alors que le nombre total de locuteurs reconnus, concernent deux municipalitÃ©s avec 89 locuteurs de langue allemande en totalitÃ© (communes Ã  facilitÃ©), Ã  un moment figurait Ã©galement Togo et Cameroun (aussi je me surprend Ã  me demander si tout cela ne contient pas une part de nostalgie). Plus dÃ©rangeant, voir totalement contraires aux rÃ¨gles Ã©thiques, faire figurer en source .. wikipedia pour un article sur le nombre de germanophones dans une rÃ©gion du BrÃ©sil.

Marcel Weinum a 16 ans a crÃ©Ã© le premier rÃ©seau de rÃ©sistance en Alsace, il a fini dÃ©capitÃ© a 18 ans Ã  Stuttgart.

Since all pets obtain food (and veterinary treatment) due to time and money spent by humans, they should be classified as parasites. It doesn't matter that the human perceives a benefit. If a mosquito injected you with ecstasy while it sucked your blood you wouldn't claim that it shouldn't be classed as a parasite.   <LF>   You're all confused. Parasitism is a relationship between members of different species in which the parasite benefits and the host is harmed. Whether or not a dog is a parasite depends on your interpretation of human losses and gains in the relationship. If you believe that humans benefit from dogs (emotionally or otherwise, it doesn't matter; emotions are not unbiological) substantially--or, as research has often shown, that our life expectancy can be increased because of their presence, then you have to conclude that the dog-human relationship is a kind of mutualism. &quot;But, it's cultural, it's related to human desires&quot; you could argue, but you'd be wrong...culture and desire are an evolved aspect of the human species and they are not phenomena that exist independently of biology and ecology.   <LF>   On the other hand, if you think people are compromising their ability to find mates or to fight diseases or to properly nourish themselves when they acquire a dog (an argument -could- be made, I suppose), then the dog is a parasite. This is a stricter scrutiny on the idea of &quot;detriment&quot; or &quot;cost.&quot; Species that expend energy for a benefit are not necessarily experiencing parasitism. A pear tree that transports its seeds to distant grounds via the bowels of a horse, and meanwhile adds to the weight that the horse must carry throughout the day -- this tree is not a parasite. Even mutualist relationships, like that of a crocodile and its dental-hygenist birds, require energy expenditure. It has to be more than that, it has to compromise the species' evolved function in its ecological niche...e.g. lessen its chances of producing fertile offspring, its chances of normal life expectancy, etc.   <LF>   Some of you, in this discussion, are using the term parasite as a [[metaphor]]. Owen Wilson's most recent character 'Dupree' is a parasite (metaphorically)...an individual &quot;living off,&quot; or otherwise burdening, another member of his own species. Hurting the host, benefiting the parasite. But this is just a way of understanding the tenor of a story or a relationship through the vehicle of a convenient biological term. The term &quot;parasitism,&quot; when used in connection with symbiosis, describes an evolutionary result of the ongoing relationship between evolved species. If I buy a dog tomorrow, and he weakens my immune system while getting fat on my dime, his parasitism is metaphorical; it's a unique dysfunction of the evoled relationship between dogs and humans (whatever that is).  A mosquito, by contrast, bites you in exactly the way that its DNA have designed it to bite you, and it benefits accordingly, at your expense. And YES, if a species of mosquito evolved that conferred positive psychotropics (maybe a benign, creativity-inspiring, low-side-effects strand of XTC) upon its host, and the benefits of the psychotropics outweighed the costs of the bite, then we would describe that as a mutualist relationship. Don't get confused by the standard or conventional (i.e. metaphorical) ways of thinking about parasitism; it should not be a moral or aesthetic issue.   <LF>   Should a link be made to Adam Smit

The organisms in symbiosis may benefit from each other but it is purely out of a need to survive and not from a desire to help the other. Cleaner fish consume parasites off of sharks but do not do this to benefit the shark but simply as a source of food. And likewise, a shark doesn't allow a cleaner fish to get close enough simply so the fish can have a meal. It allows the fish to do this so that the shark itself can be free of parasites. There are many other examples that can be given.   <LF>   Also, I think in the amensalism section of the article, it should be stated that there are two types of amensalism: competition and antibiosis. In competition, one organism excludes another from a resource. In antibiosis, one organism secretes a chemical killing the other while the one that secreted the chemical is unaffected.   <LF>   Lastly, the examples for commensalism could be better. For example, epiphytes growing on a woody plant. The epiphyte uses the woody plant as support and for access to sunlight. The woody plant is unaffected by thi

Darwin proposed that evolution progressed by natural selection, and organisms best adapted to their environments are those that thrive. There's no absolute requirement that an adaptation translate DIRECTLY into a competitive advantage. (But, of course, a parasite/symbiont that chooses a successful partner is more likely to succeed than one that doesn't.)

Therefore symbiosis can be mutualistic (for example lichens, anemonefish-anemone interactions, fig pollination, etc.), commensalistic, parasitic (most parasitic relationships are symbiotic in the sense that the parasite can only exist in or on the host)or wholly neutral.  However, in the 20th century, &quot;symbiosis&quot; came to be used exclusively for what should really be termed &quot;mutualistic symbiosis&quot;.  Biologists are now divided on the issue; some (myself included) believe that we should refer to symbiotic relationships using the original definition (symbiosis simply refers to &quot;living with&quot; and says nothing about the outcome of that living together).  Other biologists happily go along with the change in definition.  I think they're wrong, but hey ho, there's no pleasing everyone all of the time!  In that sense, therefore, there's not a &quot;universally accepted definition&quot;.  Hope that's clarified the issu

Mistletoes are generally considered parasites or hemiparasites by those who work with them.  Certain genera (Arceuthobium in particular) are known to cause serious growth reductions and mortality in their hosts. Other genera derive their water and mineral requirements from their hosts, in some cases causing severe growth reductions and mortality- particularly in drought stressed hosts. Hundreds of peer reviewed publications support these statements. See articles in forestry journals by Hawksworth, Wiens, Mathiasen, Geils among many others.

As the prose was understandable, the logic and presentation reasonably clear, and more or less in line with how Finns have used to depicture their history for me, I didn't consider a total removal, but felt a need of time, reflection and research to balance the text above, considering the following paragraph from [[Neutral point of view]]:   <LF>

Presenting all points of view says, more or less, that p-ists believe that p, and q-ists believe that q, and that's where the debate stands at present. Ideally, presenting all points of view also gives a great deal of background on who believes that p and q and why, and which view is more popular (being careful not to imply that popularity implies correctness). Detailed articles might also contain the mutual evaluations of the p-ists and the q-ists, allowing each side to give its &quot;best shot&quot; at the other, but studiously refraining from saying who won the exchange.''   <LF>   So, the main question is: Whose view is reflected in the removed paragraphs, and which view is it opposing?   <LF>   So far, I'd considered balancing it with the widespread fear/belief that Russian expansionism &quot;only needs excuses&quot;, and that the Paasikivi-balance of 1948 could be established first '''after''' [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]].   <LF>

Both are frequently encountered, but still not exactly correct. It harms no-one to spell it StrauÃŸ, so let's spell it right and stop arguing about it. The unfamiliar appearance of &quot;ÃŸ&quot; is solved by the use of the {{tl|Foreignchar}} template. Any other arguments about it being &quot;not English&quot; seem to be just xenophobia.

Since a personal name does not usually exist in foreign-language variants (there's no way we'd call the article ''John Ostrich''), there is only one spelling available. In this particular case, the discussion concerns whether or not the long-standing usage in many English-language texts of the spelling &quot;Strauss&quot; is a good enough reason to overturn the German spelling of &quot;StrauÃŸ&quot;. Chinese doesn't enter into it.

I have been asked to give here my statement: I have an originally signed autograph by Johann StrauÃŸ. It is signed by StrauÃŸ with an ÃŸ-letter at the End. My parents live in the house in the 2nd district of Vienna, where Johann StrauÃŸ II (son) has been born and where Johann StrauÃŸ (vather) lived.

Nevertheless, a friend of mine who is a descendant of Johann StrauÃŸ Snr and Eduard StrauÃŸ also spelled his name &quot;StrauÃŸ&quot; until he officially had it changed to &quot;Strauss&quot; because of his many contacts to England since &quot;ÃŸ&quot; is unknown in English. For the very same reason the Johann-Strauss-Society of Vienna spells the name this  way. On the other hand, in English language literature the spelling &quot;Strauss&quot; is indeed in use (e.g. ''Peter Kemp: The Strauss Family. Portrait of a Musical Dynasty.'' ISBN 0-8593-6265-5). Whether an English language encyclopaedia should use the one spelling or the other I cannot decide, but I do think that the sort of spelling common in the country of origin should at least be mentioned. --[[User:80.109.27.92|80.109.27.92]] 22:24, 24 October 2005 (UTC) ([[:de:Benutzer:Wolfgang glock|Wolfgang Glock]])   <LF>

You belong to the most dignified clergy and have sworn celibate, you are an old, unmarried bachelor for centuries and you remain one, otherwise the old spinsters would not rub against you. Strauss however is not an old bachelor. He already left two life companions behind himself; the one took the dear God, and the other one? - well, you know the strange story!

This, to me sounds like the definition of group.  See wikipedia article on [[Group_%28sociology%29]].    <LF>   If the same definition of group is used for organization, we would be equating a company such as IBM with a group of 3 software engineers working together.  It will also mean that what we know about how a group develops is all we need to know about how a company, an organized religion, or a sports organization develops.  Anybody has a better definition? I recall Robert Bales, a famous researcher of small groups, writing somewhere that the difference between small groups and large groups is that in a small group people are able to remember pretty much everything that was said by everybody in a group interaction.  Btw, I am working on a page on [[group development]] if others are interested.   <LF>

I am looking to make small edit to this article by adding:   <LF>   Self-managing work groups allows the members of a work team to manage, control, and monitor all facets of their work, from recruiting, hiring, and new employees to deciding when to take rest breaks. An early analysis of the first-self-managing work groups yielded the following behavioral characteristics (Hackman, 1986):   <LF>   *Employees assume personal responsibility and accountability for outcomes of their work.   <LF>   *Employees monitor their own performance and seek feedback on how well they are accomplishing their goals.   <LF>   *Employees manage their performance and take corrective action when necessary to improve their and the performance of other group members.   <LF>   *Employees seek guidance, assistance, and resources from the organization when they do not have what they need to do the job.   <LF>   *Employees help members of their work group and employees in other groups to improve job performance and raise productivity for the organization as a whole.   <LF>   2.^ Schultz, Diane P.

In the User: namspace they behave in a special way (you get a backlink to the parent page, as with [[User:Camembert/Sandbox]], for example), but in articles they're treated just like any other character, so it's fine to use them if warranted.

A lot of the words on this list are commonly pronounced the same way whether noun or verb.

Like one of those things where you know the right way to do something, but you use it so rarely that you want to apply regularization to it.  An example is the plural of a computer &quot;mouse&quot;.  While we all &quot;know&quot; it should be &quot;mice&quot;, a great number of people struggle with wanting to regularize it, but neither can they bring themselves to say &quot;*mouses&quot;.  The same sort of thing happens for me with accENT as a verb.  It doesn't sound right, but I keep getting the sense that that's how it's supposed to be said.

(See [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary]].) However, the idea of words changing from one [[part of speech]] to another when the stress is moved is an interesting one, and may well merit an article. Is this a recognised phenomenon in linguistics? Does it have a name? In what other languages does it occur? If anyone can think of an appropriate name, perhaps the page could be moved there. The article could well still include the list of words, as I don't think there is an overwhelming number of them.   <LF>   As for pronunciations being different for different speakers, explaining the differences in usage in the article would be more useful than just removing the affected words altogether. I've retrieved the words removed from the page and listed them below. I can't see what was wrong with a large proportion of them. The &quot;ak-SENT&quot; form, to take the first example, is perfectly normal in British English, so it shoudn't be removed just because the same is not true in other forms of English.   <LF>   The phrases &quot;crack down&quot;, &quot;drop out&quot;, &quot;fall out&quot;, &quot;hand out&quot; were also removed. These aren't words, so obviously don't really fit into the category being discussed. However, they do display a similar behaviour, since moving the stress to the first syllable (in writing, merging them into a single word with or without a hyphen) turns them into nouns. This could perhaps be discussed somewhere in the article.

The stress is not &quot;almost always&quot; on the penultimate, even if that's the most common case; also, the graphical stress is only compulsory if on the last syllable. So, whether the accent is on the penultimate or the antepenultimate is unpredictable, and even many native speakers tend to get some cases wrong. Napoli is the correct spelling, and NÃ poli would only ever be used by a dictionary to mark the stress - it's allowed but unexpected in real writing. NÃ¡poli is today considered incorrect; 'a', 'i', 'u' can only take a grave accent, while on 'e' and 'o' the used accent must be the grave for open vowels (IPA /É›/, /É”/), and the acute for closed vowels (IPA /e/, /o/). I've found mention of the rule you describe in the Italian wikipedia ([http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accento_grafico#L.27accento_grave_.28.60.29_e_l.27accento_acuto_.28.C2.B4.29_in_italiano]), as used until some decades ago (until the reform of 1967).   <LF>   :: Finally, utensile can be both a noun and an adjective, and can have different stress in the two cases; the adjective must be pronounced utÃ¨nsile, the noun is utensÃ¬le, or less frequently utÃ¨nsile.

Nonetheless, I'd hesitate to say that shifting the stress is a productive way to form nouns from verbs, as it is in English; rather, nouns are formed in various ways (called ''mishkalim'') from roots (''shorashim''), and verbs are formed in various different ways (called ''binyanim'') from the same roots, and it would almost seem coincidental to me if there are mishkalim that differ from binyanim only in stress placement. â

To ''inspire'' means to ''breathe into'', aluding to the [[anima]], or the breath of life.  In this case its meaning is a bit more figurative, in that being inspired means having the divine spark (of creation) breathed into you.  To &quot;expire&quot; does mean to breathe out, but may have taken on the euphemistic meaning of &quot;to breathe out one's last breath&quot; or something to that effect.  And if there's any doubt to any of this, just think of words like &quot;respiration&quot; and &quot;respirator&quot;.  I've always found it a bit humorous when foodstuffs have &quot;expiration&quot; dates; you ''know'' your food's gone bad when it starts breathing!

I think the scope of Domestic rabbit is probably right, since humans have been domesticating rabbits in a non-pet fashion for a long time (and will probably continue to do so). There is a newly created article, [[House rabbit]] that can help. It covers a large subset of Rabbits as pets, and should probably serve as a main article referenced by Domestic rabbit and possibly Rabbit.

Thereâ€™s nothing on Wikipedia about the behaviour of wild rabbits â€“ the page is almost entirely devoted to domestic rabbits, as are most of the other sites which I can find on the Internet. Surely wild rabbits are far more common than domestic ones, and yet thereâ€™s very little information about them. In the book, the rabbits have a very hierarchical society, the males appear to be fairly aggressive towards each other (or is this just a fictional device?), and the younger male rabbits live on the outskirts of the warren, possibly going off to join a new warren. If this is true, it would make biological sense, as it would reduce inbreeding. But thatâ€™s the point â€“ is this really how rabbit society functions, or is it all just an invention of the author? Isnâ€™t there anyone out there who can give us a chapter about the habits and social structure of wild rabbits?   <LF>   [[User:Arikk|Arikk]] 19:24, 12 July 2007 (UTC) Sorted.  Well, kind of.

As has been pointed out, [[Rabbit]] needs a proper introduction.   <LF>   3. [[Rabbit]] should contain minimal information specific to issues dealt with on the other two pages.  Particularly, the entire section on Rabbits as pets should be reduced to a single paragraph, with a link to [[Domestic rabbit]].  Also, the section on Rabbit behaviour in the wild (which I added...) really belongs in [[European rabbit]].   <LF>   What that leaves in [[Rabbit]] is mostly zoological and taxonomical information, and cultural and literary references.  That's a bit of a shame, since this article is going on CD.  The alternatives are to bring all the information from European and Domestic onto this page (too long), or to put those pages on the school CD too!   <LF>   What do people think?  If no one objects, I'll just go ahead and make the changes.   <LF>

This is an article about the animal, not the trivial aspects of historical names. That's what dictionaries are for.    <LF>   Realizing that Wikipedia is not censored, this irrelevancy reduces the accessibility of this article, without any benefit.

I'm confused as to why you think this isn't relevant. The history of the name in English is just as relevent as any other aspect of the animal - if you look around Wikipedia you can find etymologies in a number of other articles. The article also contains a number of other notes, also completely relevent, that talk about other aspects of rabbits as they pertain to human culture (of which language is a part). Clearly it is not just biological facts but also human cultural ideas about rabbits that are relevent to this article. And, seeing as you see no problem with the note that points out that the name *has* changed in the past, giving the actual *reason* for this change is not only a good idea it's practically demanded. Leaving a potential reader hanging by mentioning that the name changed but giving no reason is something that really would reduce the accessibility of the article.

Maybe this is a cultural difference. The word &quot;cunt&quot; is generally considered ''very'' vulgar in the US. It is jarring to come across it in an article as basic as this.   <LF>   I have nothing against the inclusion of etymologies, ''if'' they add to the understanding of the subject.

RedPenofDoom makes a good point regarding the specific terminology however, so I've rewritten it to be more accurate.

As you are no doubt well aware, Wikipedia is not censored. The only criteria here is whether or not the inclusion of the word aids in the understanding of the reader, in knowing the history of the word for the animal. We have already established that you clearly have no problem with having etymological information in the article, because if you had your edit would have consisted of removing the section &quot;naming&quot; altogether. So clearly you believe we need information on the origin of the word here. If so, we have to look at how we can make this section as clear and informative as possible. The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned, which does *not* aid understanding and accessibility. In fact it reduces it, because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been. I have therefore restored the previous version.

As to your points, I agree that wikipedia is not censored, but maintain that this article seems at best a very unusual place for that uncensored nature to be a problem.  Also, I did give consideration to simply eliminating the section, but was not so bold as to eliminate a section someone though important enough to put together.  Here is my suggested solution which 1) I believe to truly preserve the interests of all, studious etymologists and inquisitive third-graders alike; and 2) requires your help.  (See, I'm really not a name-caller by nature!)  The solution:  create a new article.  The paragraph, lock, stock and citation-filled barrel can then be relocated, but remain readily available to any with an interest in rabbit etymology.  It can have a link in this article, so those souls who really want to know the trivial-to-most origins of the term bunny rabbit can learn them in all the four-letter blue detail they'd like, but the rest of the world -- including the thousands of elementary students looking up information on this favorite furry animal -- can read the non-trivial content without what many Americans consider to be the most offensive term in the English language being highlighted in blue so it jumps off the page at them.  Win-Win if you're willing to budge just a little (and willing to help set up a new page with a link back, which I haven't yet the skill to do.)  Thanks for your consideration, Krson

The rabbits could choose between swimmer-, low pressure-bowl-, nipple- and automatic minidrinkers. In two passages, four animals in each of the four boxes have been held for four weeks and watched by video once a week during 24 hours to register the frequency of the animalsâ€™ drinking at the four alternative drinkers. The choice experiments show that the low pressure bowl-drinker has been preferred in frequency, followed by the nipple drinker. The swimmer-bowl-drinker was less frequented, the automatic minidrinker was avoided in tendency. All in all it has been shown that by offering bowl- and/or nipple-drinkers a natural adequate drinking has been presented to the rabbit

Less attention has been paid to variation that may arise from genetic differences and differences in rearing conditions. Experiments revealed that acquisition of a conditioned reflex can be affected dramatically by such differences. Specifically, the acquisition of a conditioned reflex in rabbits from 3 different suppliers was compared. All rabbits received behavioral training in which a tone or a light signalled an electrotactile stimulation of the [[trigeminal nerve]] near the rabbits' right eye. This tactile stimulus reliably elicited an eyeblink. Repeated presentations of the auditory and visual signals followed by the tactile stimulus yielded the acquisition of a conditioned response, namely closure of the eyelids during the warning period provided by the signal stimuli. Two of the groups showed steady conditioned response acquisition at a rate that matched previous results by others. However, the third group of rabbits showed very slow acquisition, and some rabbits failed to show any conditioned response acquisition. These interesting findings may also be included in the articl

Observations on domestic rabbits have shown that there are only few differences in their behavior compared with their wild counterparts. See R. Mykytowycz and E.R. Hesterman (1975), â€œAn experimental study of aggression in captive European rabbitsâ€, ''Behaviour'' 52:104-117; D.J. Bell (1984), â€œThe behaviour of rabbits: Implications for their laboratory managementâ€, ''Standards in Laboratory Animal Management'', 2.

It stated that besides a high-pitched scream when frightened or in pain, rabbits don't make any noises. This was wrong, and now the entry doesn't say anything at all. A rabbit will often soft grunting noises when hitting on another rabbit, and will make semi-vocal chewing/tooth-grinding sounds when feeling contented.

I am extremely uncomfortable with this statement, because we all know this is a full life under optimal conditions, the bunny kept as a house rabbit with an owner attentive to any medical problems. It's my understanding that a bunny of  9-12 years will be  slow-moving or likely arthritic, so  due to predation this seems an unrealistic lifespan figure for undomesticated rabbits. This is not to mention how well we could cite uterine tumours in female bunnies over 3 years of age.   <LF>   I thought there was a good reason for ''not'' giving the lifespan here - otherwise I'm surprised at its previous absence.

The first entry (apparently from the first edition of the ''M-W'' unabridged, c. 1913) says &quot;a young kitten; a whelp&quot;. Unfortunately, that site doesn't appear to link to that dictionary's entry for &quot;kitten&quot;, so we can't be sure whether it's talking about exclusively about baby catsâ€”but I'll bet it is. (A whelp, of course, is not a rabbit. It's not a cat either, afaik, but it conceivably could be. Oxford Dictionaries Online notes that it can mean &quot;cub&quot;, which can, in turn, refer to the young of any carnivorous mammal. But that's thrice removed from &quot;kitling&quot;, a bit of a stretch.) The other entry (''-Ologies and -Isms'') notes that it's British dialectal, &quot;the young of an animal, especially a kitten or young cat&quot;. My guess is that it's not only dialectal but quite rare, since Oxford Dictionaries Online doesn't have an entry for it. According to my copy of the ''Chambers Dictionary'', the word is used in Scotland, but it's not clear that it's ever used for rabbits, let alone used frequently enough to rate a mention here. Bottom line: with the possible exception of Scotland, the word seems to be obsolete or nearly so. Without depending on original research and synthesis, there's really no justification for including it.

This should be noted.   <LF>   2) Leaving any rabbit outside in an open 'pen' requires supervision at ALL times. In addition to being vulnerable to dogs, cats, snakes, and wild canines, they are even more vulnerable to birds of prey. Raptors will absolutely attack them any time of day if vulnerable. They should not ever be left alone when the pen is not fully enclosed.   <LF>   3) Given many house rabbits can jump well over 4-5 feet in the air, any open pen needs to be taller than what would be used for other animals.   <LF>   4) The &quot;A pet rabbit's diet&quot; sentence does not make grammatical sense.   <LF>   5) While rabbits can bond with virtually all animals including dogs that weigh 20x as much, there are certain animals in which bacterial infections easily spread. Rabbits and guinea pigs can easily spread a respiratory infection that can be fatal in under 24 hours (usually the guinea pig is far more at risk than the rabbit, and the rabbit is often the asymptomatic carrier).   <LF>   6) Guinea pigs and chinchillas are fragile creatures. A rabbit has the potential ability to bite hard and its hind legs can easily deliver a fatal blow to these and other small animals...even during normal play/interaction. A choice to bond these animals is one that should not be done without careful consideration as there are risks.   <LF>   7) Rabbits can easily bond with large dogs and cats...but the article needs to note that there is a &quot;formal bonding process&quot; that the owner needs to initiate and control to ensure they get along.   <LF>   8) Many house rabbits are generally not all that timid...depending on the rabbit, they can be the polar opposite of timid, shy, and easily startled. My rabbit runs full-force into the dog and starts honking to signal she is ready to play. If the dog refuses to get up, she starts stomping her feet and growling until the dog finally gives in and wakes up and starts to play. She runs towards people and animals rather than away from...and that isn't uncommon with rabbits whom interact a ton with other animals.   <LF>   9) Grunting and growling on a house rabbit doesnâ€™t necessarily mean aggressionâ€¦in some cases, it is an adapted behavior or a modified behavior intended to produce a response. For example, my rabbit growls and grunts to wake the dog up so they can playâ€¦and she runs and bumps into people to get their attention to be petted. In the wild, these behaviors have a set meaning related to aggressionâ€¦but in the house, that isnâ€™t always the case. Their behaviors and sounds are very, very contextual relative to what is happening.   <LF>   10) a rabbit can deliver a powerful and very painful biteâ€¦the part about the bite not breaking the skin is completely untrue. Their teeth are razor sharp and their jaws are quite powerful given what they eat requires serious saw/grinding power. While they often will only â€˜nipâ€™ as a warning which generally does not cause much trauma, a full force bite on a finger is enough to go through tendon/muscle and down to bone. But I do agree bites usually have warning signs before they occur and are easy to stop with behavior modification. Nonetheless, an ignorant owner can easily get them to a point of biting and they have the ability to deliver a serious bite and it is a major reason they are poorly suited to young (and especially irresponsible) children.   <LF>

I believe the correct term is a '''thermal''' relief valve (TRV), not a 'temperature' relief valve. This type of valve is used to relief the pressure caused by expansion of a liquid due to a temperature increase in an '''isolated''' section. Imagine a piece of pipe, heat exchanger, etc. filled with water (or another liquid) and exposed to a fire or other heat source. The water will expand, causing an increase of pressure. The TRV will open at a set pressure, disposing a small amount of liquid which immediately reduces the pressure. This type of valve is typically sized for a very small capacity compared to normal pressure relief valves.

If the excess pressure condition still exists with a pressure relief valve, it will not cycle like a safety valve but will stay open until the excess pressure condition is changed to reduce the system pressure.   <LF>   A safety valve must be pressure, temperature and flow rated for the application (or any combination of safety valves on the system).  In other words a safety valve, or valves if more than one is used to control the unsafe pressure condition, must be able to expell all gas or vapour the system is capable of producing. &lt;small&gt;â€”

Especially Golani, who has a huge international reputation and is one of the few violists who has made her living as a full time soloist. For 25 years she has toured and recorded. Someone keeps removing Golani and Imai from the list. Thats weird. Golani has had more than 50 concertos written for her and more than 200 works in total. I heard her concerts at the Glenn Gould studio and Wigmore Hall and was stunned by her genius. I suspect the individual removing Golani from the list (and Imai, who is an extremely eminent viola soloist, based in Holland but originally Japanese) may not have enough international knowledge of their importance. I havent added Yuri Bashmet as obviously its going to be a challenge to keep Golani and Imai on the list but I hope someone will come forward to stubbornly push for him too. The list as it stood was like a smile with three missing teeth, I have replaced two - please will someone push for Bashmet too. &lt;small&gt;â€”

By &quot;consensus&quot; (see the comment in the article text), it's to be limited to a small number (5) of representative players.

It is certainly important to protect against bloat and I can see that this issue emerged before. You (ILike2BeAnonymous) seem to very much dislike additions to the violists/viola player category. You strongly suggested that two entries be removed if I insist upon the Golani and Imai additions. I have reluctantly removed two therefore (and I hope someone else will come along and restore them). You seem to like making the rules here, but anyone can refine a Wikipedia entry. That is what I have done - by adding these two Great violists here. No one, incidentally, has established absolute &quot;objective&quot; criteria for additions to the violists entries. I am confident, however, that if it really came down to it, arbitrators who do the research on Golani and Imai will see that I have made no transgression here whatsoever but have provided the names of two very famous and unusually gifted players who have made extraordinary contributions over decades as viola virtuosi through their recordings and on the international, solist circuit. &lt;small&gt;â€”

I have myself reverted several attempts to re-grow this sentence into a list, so there is not just one editor acting as &quot;policeman&quot;. Neither is there one person who is attempting to make up rules: as you've noticed - rather late in the day - the issue has been discussed before. It would have been nice if you had taken the trouble to re-open that discussion on this page in the first place, rather than attempting to get your own way by conducting an edit war. The consensus reached, reinforced by plain common sense, was that the sentence can't be allowed to carry on growing every time someone sees that their personal favourite is not included. Once that starts, people think that there's no good reason not to add the name of that really great teacher they had in third grade. The fact that no objective criterion for inclusion exists doesn't mean that choices don't have to be made, even if they have to be done by something as crude as a Google search.    <LF>   :Just to close with a personal anecdote, a few years ago I persuaded a friend to go with me to a recital by one of the two players you've just added. I had never heard the player, but her reviews and reputation had encouraged me to suggest it. The performance was painful enough for me to have suppressed most of my recollection; when it was over, my friend looked at me in silence for a few seconds and then said &quot;I hadn't realised that the viola was such a difficult instrument&quot;.

Whether the performance was liked or not, it acknowledges the arguments that I made, that both are well known and belong on this list. The &quot;common sense&quot; of limiting the list is sensible and the policing factor important as the list could grow to be too large. Its not an issue of one's favourite player, but an issue of accuracy and logic. The existing list of players that had been constructed under the sentence &quot;More recent well-known&quot; had no logic to it and was arbitrary, it was my aim to maintain the established logic in the paragraph by consistency, not one's favourite principal player but international solists of note (whether liked or not). &quot;Rather late in the game&quot; suggests that Wikipedia is a static entity in which no one can come along and make corrections, this is not the case. Finally, the individual referred to above was indeed policing my additions since they were replying to each one of the attempts to add the two players under my Watchlist and giving (actually ordering) instructions to place those names elsewhere. I stand by these additions and am prepared to go to arbitration with them if necessary. Thanks for caring so much about this entry regardless, I think it an important category.

Probably Forsyth's claim (in an otherwise excellent book) is based on a misunderstanding about the word &quot;viola&quot;.  Before about 1535, &quot;viola&quot; referred generally to ''any'' bowed stringed instrument.  It was modified variously to describe instruments of different families (''viola da braccio'', ''soprano di viola da braccio'', ''viola da gamba'', ''viola d'amore'', etc.)  It did not mean ''specifically'' what we modernly call a viola until about the 18th century.  At any rate all the members of the violin family (now this is from Grove) developed at about the same time, in the first few decades of the 16th century.  (Should this go in the article somewhere?)

It is true that violas are very underrated compared to practically all other string instruments and can have a beautiful sound that is vital for a group's overall sound.  However, calling it the most versatile of string instruments is too easily contended with to be put in a wikipedia article.  Could I get some feedback (no pun intended) on this?

While I agree that, if we have it at all, it ought to be as as short as possible, I also hold that, once granted the section, it needs to refer to viola jokes as being more prominent than other instrument jokes (after all, that is the only reason we have this section: otherwise it appears to be a random reference to &quot;instrument jokes&quot; stating that there are instrument jokes -- and that there are viola jokes -- which is redundant and very not-useful information.  If the section itself is unencyclopedic, removing any reference to why it's there in the first place makes it doubly so).   <LF>   I also put back the reference to &quot;jokes about viola jokes&quot;, which serves to highlight further how prominent/prolific the viola joke is.   <LF>

However, it is most certainly not up to us to say that violas (or indeed any other instrument) are any better or worse than any other instrument/musician, as was the case before there were anyone else editing it (nor is it an option say that one side of any issue is better or worse than another. We must leave the reader to make up their own mind). I must ask the obvious question, and please forgive me for doing so, but in what way was it encyclopedic before? It was not a balanced article.   <LF>   By saying that violists are the object of fun any more than any other instrument (which they are not- they simply are not well known enough to be the laughing stock*) we are destroying the neutrality of the section, and thus the article. Any biased article is one too many, and this is one section which appears to want to lean to the negitive. If it cannot be neutral, which it certainly was not before the editing, then I say it ought to be deleted, and left at that.    <LF>   *(Plus I can give copious amounts of examples of jokes about almost all other mainstream instruments, all individually equalling the number and &quot;bite&quot; of viola jokes.)   <LF>

Also, your comment &quot;I don't believe the section had a '''particularly''' negative POV&quot; implies that even you believe there '''''was''''' '''some''' bias in the article.    <LF>   However, these jokes are not told anymore commonly than any other types of instrument jokes- I have played in many various youth and chamber orchestras for many, many years and I have never even heard an instrument joke told once, let alone a barrage of viola jokes that is suggested both by you (Plural), and in the article, seem to suggest. I have also played in full orchestras, jazz combos, rock mixes and have been in proffesional fierce competition with our rival ensembles and never have we heard a single viola joke. I have asked all of my peers and my former teachers and my conductor. None of them have ever heard of a many of instrument jokes, much less an insurmountable majority of viola jokes.    <LF>   While it may not have been the ''intention'' to suggest that violas are the laughing stock of the musical world and they are inferior, it was certainly the implication and as such I maintain that the article is a freely biased form of prejudice, and as such should be removed. The idea that simply because the whole viola article has a â€œviola jokes sectionâ€, the viola must be inferior is deeply flawed; it takes one person to add such a section, and as such doesnâ€™t mean that it is the â€œtruthâ€.  Also, since the viola joke is not any more prominent than any other instrument joke, saying (or rather, Speculating, perhaps?) that they are adding to the lessening the truth/ making the article â€œless truthfulâ€, as you put it.   <LF>   Also, the fact that there ''are'' '''so many''' jokes (and I don't mean viola jokes) implies that they would be told equally, if at all.    <LF>   My very, very strong recommendation is that we remove the article, and I donâ€™t think that anyone else will add it back again; the viola article did just fine without it before about May this year.

[http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/jcb/viola-presentation.html] After re-reading it, it seems less methodical of a 'study' than I remembered it being.  However it does provide a basis for the claim that viola jokes were more prominent than other types of jokes in the recent past, and it does cite evidence for their prominence from various major and international newspaper articles &amp; columns, at least one well-known humorist's book, as well as from the authors' own original research. Having found this I now propose an ammendment to my previously proposed statment:    <LF>   :&quot;In the recent past, there is evidence (mostly anecdotal) that the viola joke rose in popularity above other instrumental jokes, and although it may have since declined, the &quot;infamy&quot; gained from this joke cycle by the viola and by violists can still be felt in some situations (Rahkonen, Carl, 1994).&quo

You are right in that it is not really a study, but after researching it, it is clear that this a poorly studied and written, heavily personalized and biased text that is not well constructed. The author takes the quotes the people meant to be â€œprovingâ€ his point out of context, and misuses information when there is simply not really much evidence in the generalizations with which he provides the reader. Plus, it is not really right to have an â€œencyclopaedicâ€ article based on only a single resource, much less one which is as poorly edited as this one. Therefore, this article simply is not a suitable for the basis of a Wikipedia article or section. This article is based on Rahkonenâ€™s pov, rather than well-researched work.

I only brought up the article because I recalled reading a paper about the prominence of viola jokes, so I thought I'd go look it up.  My own experience as a musician and a violist, along with the experiences of other musicians I have spoken to, who hail from places all over the globe, leads me to believe that viola jokes are told more frequently than other kinds of musican jokes -- and that they are told more frequently in almost every music school, conservatory, orchestra (be it youth, community, or professional), and classical music festival or institute the world over.  Therefore, I assumed that, since I saw no other notable feature in viola jokes, this prominence was the very thing which caused people to want to place a section on viola jokes in this article, when no such jokes section has been brought up in connection to other orchestral string instrument's articles.  I maintain that merely stating that viola jokes are told with more frequency than other musician jokes is not in itself a negative point of view (it is merely a description of what happens).  I maintain that if the section is kept (which  is a position I have never wholeheartedly supported), it must refer to this prominence -- otherwise, by leaving out the only possible reason for mentioning the jokes, it becomes at best a very silly section which may leave readers wondering why it is there, and at worst a rather biased section which gives readers the impression that some Wikipedia editor thinks viola jokes themselves are somehow worthy of being described because of their great wit, charm, originality, and intellectual appeal.

However, as I have previously stated I have '''never''' heard a viola joke be told, and it would be ridiculous to say that the people that I have met and asked, both in the musical and general community, have all been &quot;mysteriously isolated from viola jokes&quot;.   <LF>   This (at the very least) equals and cancels out your assertion that you have met so many &quot;viola joke specialists&quot;, and I have worked and/or studied in all of the institutions that you have mentioned and never one instrument joke has been uttered, much less a viola joke.    <LF>   Also, I am clearly not the only person to be aware of the weaknessess of this wikipedia article. There were at least 2 others that saw the bias of the section, and clearly voiced their own outrage(this does not imply that my reaction is ooutrage, but that they were very angry about it), and as we know, not a great number of people can either actually A)Know how to edit an article B) Know how to leave a &quot;talk&quot; message, so your claim (which is verging on rude, so be careful to keep civil &quot;: P&quot;) that &quot;people, except [me]&quot; &quot;have no problem with it&quot;, is downright wrong. I daresay that the people that left those messages are also likely represent a large number of people that see the bias.    <LF>   As few people are likely to research their own instrument, the violists are unlikely to read the article, so the people that would best to edit and write about the viola (i.e. violists) would not actually be the ones to write the article, so we are left with people that, by majority are most likely not primarily violists.   <LF>   The entire (according to your argument) basis of the article is &quot;common knowledge&quot;. However, as we have established, those which you have (apparently) heard are, at a minimum, negated by mine, and my experiences (you can only compare individual experiences with one another- you can't have 2 or more compared to only one person) it is not common knowledge. How can it be &quot;common knowledge&quot; if, forgive me, the &quot;knowledge&quot; is not &quot;common&quot;. This section is based not fact but rather a misconception at best.    <LF>   Also if we take that man's 1994 article as true, they were (perhaps)popular in c. 1992-3. this is certainly no reason for having an article on it 12+ years later.     <LF>   You previously said that the article that you referred to from the mit site &quot;does provide a basis for the claim that viola jokes were more prominent than other types of jokes in the recent past, and it does cite evidence for their prominence from various major and international newspaper articles &amp; columns, at least one well-known humorist's book, as well as from the authors' own original research&quot;.You also said that there was &quot;mostly anecdotal&quot; evidence. However, after I &quot;poked holes&quot; in this poorly written article, you now say that it is &quot;common knowledge&quot;. I'm sorry, but one '''''cannot''''' go from saying that there is merely &quot;mostly anecdotal&quot; evidence to the suppossed prominence of viola jokes being some thing that &quot;everyone knows&quot; and that is &quot;common knowledge&quot;, as you said. I have managed to debunk most of the pro viola-joke arguments so far and, as it is, it looks like I will be able to continue to do so. It seems, with due dignity, that the relavence for the jokes section of this article is fading and the supposed reasons for the section are holding on for dear life.   <LF>   If, as you suggest, the viola joke section is based on the idea that they are more prominant than other jokes, and that this was the reason for the section, then it should most certainly be deleted.

In other words, any given player will use less length of bow on a viola than a violin, so bows are built accordingly.

Firstly the mention of the 'avant garde' as commensurate with pop music. Pop music is, by definition, not avant garde. In fact the 'avant garde' article that it links to makes no mention of popular music in the 'music' section. This could easily be rectified.   <LF>   The other thing that jars is this statement: &quot;It is quite unusual though, to use individual string instruments in contemporary popular music.&quot; This seems to fly in the face of the fact that the guitar is by far the most popular instrument in pop music, followed, probably, by the piano. Both string instruments. This could very easily be improved, but when I tried to make an edit I was told it was corrected automatically. &quot;ClueBot NG makes very few mistakes&quot;, it says.

Some people assume that White Nationalism is related to &quot;[[White supremacism]]&quot; although the two concepts actually stand in opposition by their very definition since White  Nationalism advocates separation and the rights of a people of common genetic and cultural heritage to have sovereign rule over itself, while supremacism advocates racial supremacy and oppression.   <LF>   One of the major driving forces behind White Nationalism is a double standard perceived by its members as prevalent in western civilization that allows, even encourages racial and ethnic nationalism among non-whites, and suppresses and pathologizes it among whites.    <LF>   The term &quot;[[race]]&quot; holds value for White Nationalists, who base their personal identity upon genetic characteristics to varying degrees. Unlike  egalitarianism, White Nationalism argues that race is real and entails significant human group differences in behavioral psychology, social identity, and physiology.    <LF>   The term White Nationalist has been used by [[Neo-Nazi]], [[Ku Klux Klan]],  [[Christian Identity]] and [[Aryan Nations]] groups, which have generally  overlapping ideologies based on the perceived necessity to maintain white racial integrity.   <LF>   Partially as a result of the violent and radical image of some of the white supremacist groups, a growing number of White Nationalists have adopted less hostile rhetoric, and portray themselves as [[conservatism|conservatives]] interested in maintaining traditional values, including white dominance in American life. Many of these groups do not advocate white supremacy and instead call for white separatism.  Some reject the label of &quot;racist&quot; in favor of &quot;racialist&quot; or &quot;racial realist&quot; due to the popular misconception that racism requires racial hatred.   <LF>   [[American Renaissance (group)|American Renaissance]] and the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] are two leading examples of mainstream White Nationalist organizations in the  United States. In Europe, several &quot;far&quot; right political parties such as the [[British National Party]], France's [[Front National]], and the [[Austrian Freedom Party]] have won fairly wide support based on platforms characterized by the mass media as advocating racial separatism in addition to traditional nationalism. Some critics of more mainstream conservativism in the United States and the United Kingdom go further and claim an undercurrent of white nationalism exists in right wing politics (i.e  [[Willie Horton]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Pete Wilson]], [[Enoch Powell]])- a  charge most conservatives bitterly contest.   <LF>   White Nationalists often have a definition of whiteness that is narrower than that in mainstream usage.  Many White Nationalists use cultural as well as  genetic criteria for determining whiteness: one oft-cited rule of thumb is that a white person is a &quot;descendant of European Christendom.&quot;  Others use  strictly genetic criteria, without cultural distinctions.  Jews and Muslims are rarely considered white by White Nationalists, even if they appear to be European, mostly for historical and cultural reasons: many White Nationalists argue that both groups are already represented by their own forms of racial nationalism. Others exclude them based on the &quot;descendants of European Christendom&quot; cultural-genetic criterion above.   <LF>   In white minority nations such as South Africa or some Latin American states, there are often arguments for white homelands as well.   <LF>

Some feel that repealing laws which infringe on white freedom of association is sufficient, and do not advocate legally-enforced separation.  In the middle, there's the majority opinion that separatist WN nations should be established, rather than an enforced separation for all whites, willing or no.  On the &quot;right,&quot; there's the opinion that historically white nations like the U.S.A. and Europe should enforce mass expulsion of non-Whites.  Even this is an oversimplification - there is no monolithic WN position on this, for example many WNs feel that European nations should expel all non-whites, but the U.S.A. should only make room for racial enclaves.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Another problem is the &quot;racial purity&quot; passage.  &quot;Racial purity&quot; is misleading, again because there is no WN consensus even on whether there is such a thing, let alone whether it is a goal of WNism.  I'm a scientific racist myself, that is, racial reality informs all my beliefs about terms like &quot;racial purity.&quot;  I am fully aware of the fuzzy borders of race in terms of genetics, and I reject terms like &quot;racial purity&quot; as less than useful.  &quot;Racial distinctiveness&quot; or &quot;racial heritage&quot; or &quot;genetic identity&quot; are all far more useful (and accurate) terms than &quot;racial purity.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   The term &quot;race&quot;, though according to some long dispensed-with in terms of any meaningful scientific value, still holds social value for many who (in part or in whole) base their personal identity upon genetical characteristics.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;&quot;Though according to some long dispensed-with in terms of any meaningful scientific value&quot; - is this really the place to insert this information?  Is this a definition of White Nationalism, or a refutation of it?  This kind of schizophrenia runs throughout the original, and makes for poor writing.  As I stated above, I don't expect this entry to be a WNist tract, but I do expect an honest representation of what WNism is, and I do expect enough room for that representation to breathe.  I'm sure the entry on race that is linked to has more than enough grist for the race-denial crowd.  Even if this caveat does belong here, it shouldn't be included in the same paragraph that sets forth the WN beliefs concerning race, much less in the same sentence.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   In all parts of the world, personal identity reflects the degree of awareness and connectivity to the outside world and foreign cultures, thus &quot;race issues&quot; tend to be seen as related to xenophobia, ethnocentrism, and other &quot;culture clash&quot; paradigms.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Let me be frank and ask, just what the hell does that mean?  This is a muddy sentence that is badly in need of a rewrite.  I can't even figure out what it means, so it's hard to determine if it would belong or not if rewritten.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Similar concerns that may be a catalyst for a distinction of personal identity are religion, gender, language, and differences regarding these issues are often manifested in conflict of one form or another.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;How are conflicts over religion, gender, and language directly related to racial nationalism?  If there's a point to be made here, make it, or remove this detritus.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Some of these groups have condoned violence in the past, and some have built up strong followings mainly in prisons.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;The issue of violent behavior and rhetoric among WN groups deserves its own paragraph, if it's to be broached, I think.  &quot;[A]nd some have built up strong followings, mainly in prisons,&quot; is an obvious attempt to link WNism with the old pathology canard.  The National Alliance, America's foremost WN advocacy group, has a membership in which the highly educated and members of the professions are overrepresented by a factor of seven when compared to the American population at large.  This is as relevant as the &quot;mainly in prisons&quot; bit.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   As a result of the violent and radical image of some of the white supremacist groups, a growing number of white nationalists have adopted less hostile rhetoric, and portray themselves as conservatives interested in maintaining traditional values, including white dominance in American life.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;The growing strength of mainstream, non-violent voices in WN groups is not solely a result of the violent and radical image of some white supremacist groups, therefore I rewrote it as being part of the impetus.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Many of these groups deny advocating white &quot;Supremacy&quot; and instead call for &quot;Separatism&quot; - often with the canard that 'mainstream' minority groups such as the NAACP and LULAC are &quot;separatist&quot; as well.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;It is not only true that many of these groups deny advocating white supremacy, many groups actually do not advocate white supremacy.  This sort of not-so-subtle phrasing is part of what I object to.  Is this to be an honest presentation of WNism, or a refutation of WNism?  As for the &quot;canard&quot; statement, this has little to do with WNist belief, even if true.  I've never heard a WN refer to the NAACP as a &quot;separatist&quot; group.  I have many times heard from WNs the complaint that advocacy groups for non-whites are publically supported and given positive press, while advocacy groups for whites are automatically classified as &quot;white supremacists.&quot;  This is a quite salient distinction, no?&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Many also reject the label of &quot;Racist&quot; for &quot;racialist&quot;, and point to studies which the contend show clear disparities in &quot;racial&quot; abilities.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;The WN view on race and racial science deserves it's own paragraph, not just the second half of a sentence.  It's also worth explaining why many WNs reject the term &quot;racist,&quot; if it's worth mentioning the rejection itself.  Some may object to my rewrite above, but in my experience the word &quot;hatred&quot; does not appear in dictionaries in the definition of &quot;racism,&quot; while it does appear in the definition of the term in the vernacular.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   In Europe, several far right political parties such as the British National Party, France's Front National, and the Austrian Freedom Party have won fairly wide support based on platforms widely seen as advocating racial separatism in addition to traditional nationalism.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;I changed &quot;far right&quot; to &quot;'far' right&quot; above because that is the common characterization, it isn't hard fact.  I also felt worth adding the fact that that characterization is one expressed in the media, but that doesn't make it necessarily so.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Jewish and Muslim peoples are rarely considered &quot;white&quot;, even if they appear to be European.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;If this is to be mentioned, an explanation is required.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Hispanics, Portuguese, and Italian people may or may not be considered white, based on regional backgrounds (Basque Spaniards and Northern Italians may be accepted while Sicilians and Puerto Ricans aren't).   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;This passage is extremely problematic.  First of all, Portugal and Italy are nations, not races, and currently neither nationality carries racially exclusive connotations.  Swedish and Russian people &quot;may or may not be considered white&quot; too.  So, the passage is nonsensical.  Second, &quot;Hispanic&quot; is a very racially ambiguous term, and essentially includes a variety of racial groups whose membership in the group &quot;Hispanic&quot; essentially boils down to language and history, not to race.  Third, the idea that Sicilians and Puerto Ricans are considered non-white by all WNs is simply wrong.  Many WNs recognize that some Puerto Ricans are at least genetically white, and most accept Sicilians as white.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Put simply, this passage needs to go, it's far more wrong than right.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   In white minority nations such as South Africa or some Latin American states, there are often arguments for a &quot;white homeland&quot; as well, and white Nationalism takes on a more literal meaning.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;There are indeed arguments for white homelands in South Africa and some Latin American nations, but I fail to see how there WNism takes on a more literal meaning - explication is called for here.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;These are by no means my only problems with the original, there are quite a few errors of omission, widespread muddled language, subtly hostile language (the consistent unnecessary use of quotes around terms like white, race, whiteness, white homeland, etc.) and outright grammatical errors as well, but I won't deal with them now.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Regarding the links, I think an explanation of WNism deserves a bit more than a single link to a WN forum.  So, I included links to some salient WNist or WN-sympathetic sites.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   ~Svigor   <LF>

White nationalists are invariably white supremacists, and we shouldn't pander to their idiotic claims by acting as though this is not the case (one statement claiming a 'seperate but equal' position will often be followed moments later by an outright racist - and thus white supremacist - statement).   <LF>

If you're going to conflate white nationalism (racial nationalism for white people) with white supremacy, perhaps you should define the latter.  As for what constitutes white, one of the more popular definitions is &quot;descendants of European Christendom.&quot;  The fact is that politically, for myself and many other white nationalists, the issue of racial supremacy is 100% politically irrelevant; my personal feelings as to which race is &quot;best&quot; or &quot;better&quot; or &quot;supreme&quot; simply don't enter the picture.  I value the white race, I want to see it thrive, and my politics follow.  An excellent analogy is family sentiment; we want to see our families succeed, we want them to grow, and questions of &quot;supremacy&quot; don't really matter.  Poor, stupid, uneducated families and rich, smart, educated families generally share this sentiment, regardless of feelings of supremacy or superiority or inferiority.   <LF>

This is better dealt with at [[white separatism]], however, which is a fairly unambiguous name for that viewpoint, and mirrors [[black separatism]].   <LF>   * White nationalism can be support for the idea that white people share a common heritage and ought to share a common identity as an abstract &quot;nation of people&quot; (not nation as in nation-state), and perhaps also have advocacy groups to work on their behalf, essentially white versions of groups like the [[NAACP]] (a group that works on the behalf of black people).  I think this is primarily what ought to be described here, and it also parallels [[black nationalism]] closely, so we keep our terminology consistent.   <LF>   * White nationalism can also be white supremacism, in the same sort of sense that US nationalism can be US supremacism (belief that the US is superior to other countries).  This should be mentioned, and critics of white nationalists that accuse them of being white supremacists in disguise should also be mentioned, but the primary documentation of the white supremacist movement itself should be at [[white supremacism]].  Note also that this must be done carefully: it is undoubtedly true that there are closet white supremacists who masquerade as white nationalists, but in the minefield of [[identity politics]], accusations of [[racism]] are thrown around quite commonly in all directions.   <LF>

A minority of white separatists do indeed seek such an enforced separation of the races, but in my experience the vast majority recognize that forcing a large population of anti-ethnocentric whites to live in a white separatist state would doom that state to failure.  Most white separatists welcome a parting of the ways between anti-ethnocentric whites and ethnocentric whites.  In fact, a great many WNs and white separatists identify the white anti-racist ruling class of the western world (safely ensconced in its limousines whilst traveling between its all-white gated communities and its cloisters) and white anti-racists in general as their most powerful enemies.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Historically, white nationalism has been connected to opposition to black civil rights and to white supremacism.    <LF>   &lt;b&gt;I think explication is needed here.  How, why, and when has WNism been historically connected to white &quot;supremacism&quot; [sic] and opposition to black civil rights?  Whether or not this connection still exists and, if different today, how so is also relevant.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Many modern white nationalists explicitly deny being white supremacists, arguing that they merely wish for each group of people with shared heritage, including white people, to be allowed to promote and preserve its heritage, and do not desire to oppress or dominate other races as racial supremacists do. However, many of their critics charge that white nationalism is simply white supremacism in disguise.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;I'd like very much to find a way to express the idea that &quot;many modern white nationalists explicitly deny being white supremacists,&quot; and the idea that many modern white nationalists indeed &lt;i&gt;are not&lt;/i&gt; white &quot;supremacists&quot; [sic], without the writing seeming schizophrenic.  I don't have any ideas on how to do that at the moment, I just wanted to point this out.  Kudos to the author (Delirium?) on the &quot;to be allowed&quot; part, that really is starting to get to the crux of the matter, as it is congruent with the fact that most white nationalists do not seek to enforce racial separation across the board.&lt;b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Are X vs.Y articles allowed, i.e. socialism vs. communism, libertarianism vs. liberalism?  If so, I think white nationalism vs. white &quot;supremacism&quot; [sic] would make a capital addition to the collection.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   The term &quot;race&quot;, though according to some long dispensed-with in terms of any meaningful scientific value, still holds social value for many who (in part or in whole) base their personal identity upon genetic characteristics, especially those that affect outward appearance.    <LF>

Is this a definition of White Nationalism, or a refutation of it? [snip] As I stated above, I don't expect this entry to be a WNist tract, but I do expect an honest representation of what WNism is, and I do expect enough room for that representation to breathe. I'm sure the entry on race that is linked to has more than enough grist for the race-denial crowd. Even if this caveat does belong here, it shouldn't be included in the same paragraph that sets forth the WN beliefs concerning race, much less in the same sentence.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;[new criticism] This statement is no better than its previous incarnation (which appeared sans the &quot;especially those that affect outward appearance&quot; addition), and demonstrably worse.  There is absolutely NO basis for the idea that white nationalists base their personal identity vis-a-vis race &quot;especially [on] those [genetic characteristics] that affect outward appearance.&quot;  Generally, and especially among the WN intelligentsia, WNs see the surface differences between races as &lt;i&gt;markers&lt;/i&gt; for race, not as the important substance of race.  Of course, social identity theory tells us that these surface differences are important in and of themselves, but generally, they are held by WNs and race-realists essentially as race-identifiers, not as the significant part of racial differences.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;In other words, contrary to the wildly popular delusion, it isn't all or mostly or even significantly about skin color.  Skin color generally ranks near the bottom of the list of the average WN's &quot;racial differences list,&quot; far below behavioral genetics, except as a race-marker.  Try a post at Stormfront.org about how racism is all about skin color or surface differences, and enjoy the mockery you receive.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   In all parts of the world, personal identity reflects the degree of awareness and connectivity to the outside world and foreign cultures, thus &quot;race issues&quot; tend to be seen as related to xenophobia, ethnocentrism, and other &quot;culture clash&quot; paradigms.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;This still makes no sense.  Can someone explain the significance and meaning of this passage to me?  I still maintain that it's muddy and pointless.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Similar concerns that may be a catalyst for a distinction of personal identity are religion, gender, language, and differences regarding these issues are often manifested in conflict of one form or another.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;This still has no direct bearing on the subject at hand - what in the blue blazes does this have to do with white nationalism, specifically?  Doesn't this belong in some other entry, in &quot;personal identity&quot; perhaps?&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Some of these groups have condoned violence in the past, and some have built up strong followings mainly in prisons.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;There are many Republicans and Democrats in prison too, what's the point?  It's also too general - which groups, when, and where are the references?  Otherwise, it just looks to me like what it probably is - an attempt to pathologize white nationalism and associate it with criminality.  I think I'd find an in-depth study of this issue very illuminating.  As I said before, the National Alliance has a membership in which the highly educated and members of the professions are overrepresented by a factor of 7 compared to the public.  This is still as relevant as the unsubtle prison assertion.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;I mean really, many Hispanic identity groups are mainly prison societies, is that to characterize the article about Hispanic identity groups (if there is such a beast?).  Many historically Jewish identity movements are mainly communistic affairs, should we slide that little tidbit into the section on Jewish identity or Zionism?&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   As a result of the violent and radical image of some of the white supremacist groups, a growing number of white nationalists have adopted less hostile rhetoric, and portray themselves as conservatives interested in maintaining traditional values, including white dominance in American life.    <LF>   &lt;b&gt;The growing strength of mainstream, non-violent voices in WN groups is not solely a result of the violent and radical image of some white supremacist groups, therefore I think this sentence should begin with &quot;partly.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Many of these groups deny advocating white &quot;Supremacy&quot; and instead call for &quot;Separatism&quot; - often with the canard that 'mainstream' minority groups such as the NAACP and LULAC are &quot;separatist&quot; as well.    <LF>   &lt;b&gt;It is not only true that many of these groups deny advocating white supremacy, many groups actually do not advocate white supremacy. This sort of not-so-subtle phrasing is part of what I object to. Is this to be an honest presentation of WNism, or a refutation of WNism? As for the &quot;canard&quot; statement, this has little to do with WNist belief, even if true. I've never heard a WN refer to the NAACP as a &quot;separatist&quot; group. I have many times heard from WNs the complaint that advocacy groups for non-whites are publically supported and given positive press, while advocacy groups for whites are automatically classified as &quot;white supremacists.&quot; This is a quite salient distinction, no?&lt;b&gt;   <LF>   Many also reject the label of &quot;Racist&quot; for &quot;racialist&quot;, and point to studies which they contend show clear disparities in &quot;racial&quot; abilities.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;The WN view on race and racial science deserves it's own paragraph, not just the second half of a sentence. It's also worth explaining why many WNs reject the term &quot;racist,&quot; if it's worth mentioning the rejection itself. Some may object to my proposed rewrite (in archive1), but in my experience the word &quot;hatred&quot; does not appear in dictionaries in the definition of &quot;racism,&quot; while it does appear in the definition of the term in the vernacular.&lt;b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;It would also be nice to dispense with the not-so-subtly disparaging quotes around the term &quot;racial.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   American Renaissance and the Council of Conservative Citizens are two leading examples in the United States.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;They're two examples of what?  This is poor writing.  The only logical conclusion is that the examples being cited either are being cited to support something that hasn't been stated, or they are being cited to support the last applicable idea put forward in the previous paragraph (i.e., Amren and CoC include the &quot;canard that 'mainstream' minority groups&quot; are separatist.  The former seems more likely since the latter is patently absurd and demands references.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   In Europe, several far right political parties such as the British National Party, France's Front National, and the Austrian Freedom Party have won fairly wide support based on platforms widely seen as advocating racial separatism in addition to traditional nationalism.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;I think the &quot;widely seen&quot; bit needs to be supported or withdrawn.  Just because the press says it doesn't make it so - the American public feels the same way, if the latest Pew study on mass media credibility is to be believed.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Jewish and Muslim peoples are rarely considered &quot;white&quot;, even if they appear to be European.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;If this is to be mentioned, an explanation is required.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   Hispanics, Portuguese, and Italian people may or may not be considered white, based on regional backgrounds (Basque Spaniards and Northern Italians may be accepted while Sicilians and Puerto Ricans aren't).    <LF>   &lt;b&gt;This passage is extremely problematic. First of all, Portugal and Italy are nations, not races, and currently neither nationality carries racially exclusive connotations. Swedish and Russian people &quot;may or may not be considered white&quot; too. So, the passage is nonsensical. Second, &quot;Hispanic&quot; is a very racially ambiguous term, and essentially includes a variety of racial groups whose membership in the group &quot;Hispanic&quot; essentially boils down to language and history, not to race. Third, the idea that Sicilians and Puerto Ricans are considered non-white by all WNs is simply wrong. Many WNs recognize that some Puerto Ricans are at least genetically white, and most accept Sicilians as white.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Put simply, this passage needs to go, it's far more wrong than right.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   In white minority nations such as South Africa or some Latin American states, there are often arguments for a &quot;white homeland&quot; as well, and white Nationalism takes on a more literal meaning.   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;There are indeed arguments for white homelands in South Africa and some Latin American nations, but I fail to see how there WNism takes on a more literal meaning - explication is called for here.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Again, these aren't my only problems with the existing article, but I think we're moving in the right direction.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>   &lt;b&gt;Regarding external links - deleting the links to WN and WN-sympathetic sites is simply reprehensible.  I'm no expert on the anti-WN presence on the Web, so I'll leave those links to others (I'd be bored and irritated by the inevitable accusations concerning &quot;softball&quot; anti-WN links anyways).  Before anyone removes the any pro-WN links provided, I'd advise a quick perusal of the number and nature of external links at the Zionism article for perspective: there are 21 of them (or there were as of June 10th), and fully two thirds of them are pro-Zionist.&lt;/b&gt;   <LF>

The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.   <LF>      2.

Restricting membership to law-abiding heterosexual whites with white partners/spouses is &quot;supremacy&quot;?  Perhaps you can explain, given the definition of supremacy we're all working with here outside of Bizarro World.   <LF>   Here is an example from H. Millard:[http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=5561]   <LF>   &quot;Fast forward to today when immigration is not primarily from White Europe, but from the Brown Third World. Will a Brown America be the same as a White America? Of course not. The genetic mix will determine the nature of the country, as it always has and as surely as the ingredients and their quantities in a recipe in a kitchen determines the nature of the meal. If current trends continue, we're going to be a Brown Third World nation, not a White First World nation. You may think this is a good thing, or you may think it is a bad thing, but that's where we're heading unless things change. And it has little to do with illegal vs. legal immigration.    <LF>   &quot;So, what does becoming a Brown Third World nation mean in a practical sense? Well, just for the heck of it I grabbed some statistics on two states that I knew were different from each other genetically but which were similar in other important ways, such as income and population size, to see what a less-White America promises. You can do the same thing for different states and will probably come up with even greater disparities, but here's what I came up with between New Mexico and Maine. New Mexico is the 39th most populous state and Maine is the 40th. If humans are fungible, you might expect to see similar violent crime rates among different populations. That's not what we see in these two states and its not what we see in any examples that I've ever seen. My guess is that if you took all the people of Maine and put them in New Mexico and you took all the people of New Mexico and put them in Maine that the violent crime rates of the two states would be reversed. It's not the geography that matters, but the people.    <LF>   &quot;According to the 2000 Census, the estimated population of the state of Maine was 1,274,923 and it was 96.9% non-Hispanic White. The violent crime rate was a very low 109.6 per 100,000 people. This makes it the 49th most violent state.    <LF>   &quot;Contrast that to the state of New Mexico with 1,819,046 residents and which was only 44.71% non-Hispanic White. The violent crime rate was a very high 757.9 per 100,000 people. This makes it the 4th most violent state.    <LF>   &quot;As the percentage of Whites in the population of America drops, so too, among many other things, will the crime-free First World quality of life drop. Think not? Prove me wrong with facts and figures. I have an open mind, and I'm willing to listen to logical arguments.

To be frank, the problem people have vis-a-vis categorization of politically-ethnocentric whites is that they want to refer to them all as white supremacists because the term has negative popular cache, sounds more aggressive than WNism or white separatism, and makes for better guilt-by-association ad hominem.

There is an abundance of information correlating behaviour and IQ to race, and it should be recognized that race will play a large part in defining such factors. Race is clearly the basis for outward appearance, so it stands to reason that it would affect other things, including the brain, and hundreds if not thousands of studies have supported this hypothesis. I understand that discussion of racial differences beyond appearance has been made taboo in our society, but the evidence showing these differences should at least be considered.   <LF>

It is possible that race could effect IQ and behavior. But there isn't any conclusive evidence that the correlation of various IQ's and such is ''caused'' by race, as the sentence I edited tried to portray. I personally think there probably are some differences that are biological, but I also think that the vast majority of them are due more to culture than to biology. Heck, as the article says, some scientists don't even think race exists outside of a cultural construct! So to say someone's race effects their intelligence and behavior in the same way it effects their appearance is incredibly inconclusive and biased. If someone wants to rewrite those thing in with those clarifications feel free, but the edit I made only undid something that was recently added itself.

Outward appearance is very powerful as far as something which human beings use to naturally classify things, but as an overall genetic determinant, it's fairly feeble. Consider, for instance, [[Strom Thurmond]]'s daughter by a &quot;black&quot; mother. Given that the mother undoubtedly has some &quot;white&quot; ancestry herself, the daughter is obviously genetically closer, overall, to a &quot;white&quot; American than to any actual Africans. Yet, racially, she is &quot;black&quot; and would be lumped in with [[Desmond Tutu]] rather than, for instance Strom himself. This is true of most &quot;black&quot; Americans, who actually represent a huge assortment of genetic mixes from almost all &quot;white&quot; to almost all African, with a random sampling of Native American, Asian, and pretty much anything else tossed in. And of course, there are an unknown number of supposedly &quot;white&quot; Americans who have an unknown percentage of &quot;black&quot; ancestry. As such, it makes as much sense to try to correlate behavior, test scores, etc. with &quot;blackness&quot; genetically as it would to correlate dogs' behavior with black coloring on a genetic basis. It should be pretty clear that, in the absence of any more sophisticated markers for actual African genetics, any perceivable differences in behavior, test scores, etc. between &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; Americans would be much more likely to be environmentally linked to skin color than genetically linked, and &quot;serious consideration&quot; of same tends to be limited only to those who have preconceived notion

Studies have shown, with mountains of indirect evidence, that there probably is a genetic component to intelligence. I find it odd that anyone speaking about this subject would not already know that.   <LF>   One such study showed that black children adopted into middle-class white families did not, on average, have higher IQs than the rest of the black population. If it is known that white people have a higher average IQ than black people, which has been demonstrated, and that this difference is purely environmental, you should conclude that those black children would have the same IQ as middle-class whites. They did not. This in itself is very convincing for the claim of a genetic factor, as indirect as it may be.   <LF>   Another study done on white and black children showed that when offered one lollipop that day, or two lollipops three days later, many more of the black children chose one lollipop that day than did the white children. This demonstrates a shorter time-horizon and an inability to maintain personal restraint among the black children, while the white children showed more of an aptitude for thinking ahead.   <LF>   And still more, a study was done on black and white individuals to determine their &quot;g Factor&quot;, or general intelligence. It basically went as follows: Repeat a series of increments of numbers, adding a set of two numbers when those numbers are given by the instructor. Then, do the same thing but repeat the numbers backwards. For example; 24-35-61, and the sets continue until you cannot continue. Then another set of numbers is given but to be repeated backwards; so the instructor says 34-15-69, but the subject has to repeat the numbers backwards, 96-51-43, etc. The study showed that the black subjects did about as well as the white subjects when adding forwards, but when adding backwards, which requires more &quot;general intelligence&quot;, they faired much worse.   <LF>   These and a plethora of other studies done on intelligence provide, as I said, mountains of evidence for believing that intelligence is partly genetic.   <LF>   As for the debate on White Nationalism:   <LF>   The difference between White Nationalism and White Supremacy, to me, is very simple. White Supremacy advocates hatred through it's belief that whites are inherently superior. White Nationalism does not advocate hatred, although it's adherents tend to believe most of the same things White Supremacists believe. White Supremacists tend to be driven by hatred, while White Nationalists are driven by what they consider rationality and logic. Groups like the National Alliance or National Vanguard, the Aryan Nations or any other neo-Nazi group tend to promote genocide, although it is not seen by them as likely to happen. If you listen to the music these groups promote, the lyrics are often genocidal in nature, such as &quot;piles of dead Jews&quot; or &quot;Holocaust, Holocaust, 2000&quot;, referring to the desire for modern day genocide to finish off the Jews.   <LF>   White Nationalists such as Jared Taylor shy away from anti-Semitism mainly for two reasons 1) They aren't actually anti-Semetic and 2) Many White Nationalists or Seperatists who are academics, have many Jewish colleagues who are on &quot;their side&quot;. Much of the research done on race and intelligence is done by Jewish scholars. White Nationalists lean more towards anti-Zionism, which they see as a pervasive force within the U.S. government, lobbying, and policy-making. Whether someone is Jewish or not is not a factor, since not all Jews are Zionists and not all Zionists are Jews. They also oppose &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; Zionists, Evangelicals and Neo-Conservatives who all strongly support Israel. As inherent isolationists, they see the strong support of Israel as not only unnecessary but dangerous, because of it's supposed repracutions with other nations. Political support of Israel by the government is seen as the Israeli lobby's immense power of persuasion over the government, which they believe should not be influenced by foreign powers or U.S. citizens sympathetic to those powers, who for example, often times have familial ties to that nation. The White Supremacists stance is filled with conspiracy thoeries and blind hatred towards Jews.   <LF>

These children's IQ may of been raised by a better environment, yet held back due to social conditions, or any other social stigmas.

You are mistaken in thinking that people who call    <LF>   themselves white nationalists, or who more often are labeled as white nationalists, are actually white supremacists. Although some of those people who do, such as David Duke, are actually supremacists. There are also different variants of supremacists/nationalists/seperatists. One definition of white nationalist, and probably the most accurate, is one who wishes to maintain a white majority within their respective nation. I will cite an example of an individual who I would consider a white nationalists, who could not be considered a supremacist, unless done so by extremely biased means.   <LF>   James Edwards is the host of a Memphis radio show called The Political Cesspool. He was a political aide for Pat Buchanan's 2000 presidential campaign. He is a member of a group, Council of Conservative Citizens, which is often called racist or white supremacist. The guests on his show are anyone from Bay Buchanan, to Sonny Landham, to Jamie Kelso, who I believe administrates StormFront. The Political Cesspool is also considered a hate-group by the SPLC. There isn't much controversial about Edward's views on race, except his view that the U.S. should stay majority white to maintain it's &quot;Anglo-Celtic&quot; heritage. He also acknowledges racial differences in IQ, and high levels of non-white crime. He would be a good example of a sort of white nationalist that is extremely moderate when it comes to the racist-right's views on race. Perhaps a section should be created to address this.   <LF>

I agree that there are many different groups of people who work against eachother.

Wikipedia has criteria of ''notability'' and accuracy, and proposals by very small groups, and individual views, merit no more than a mention in an overview articl

The British nationalists, French nationalists, and German nationalists aren't WHITE nationalists. The BNP (British National Party) promotes a Britain for white Britons though. The BNP disagrees with many issues of White Nationalists in general such as creating a nation for all Whites; the BNP espouses the idea of a nation for the native British people and ONLY for native BRITISH people. White Nationalism, on the other hand, is for the creation of a separate state for Whites only. Here is a FAQ from a very reputable member of the White Nationalist movement, his name is YGGDRASIL, he speaks for many White Nationalists, just read up on him on Stormfront and on his webpage: http://www.whitenationalism.com/wn/wn-06.htm   and here's an excerpt of the first question:    <LF>   1. Q. What is White Nationalism?   <LF>   A. The idea that Whites may need to create a separate nation as a means of defending themselves.   <LF>   Will Beback, I know JohnJoyTree posted his White Nationalist Position Statements, one by one, on the forum, for everyone to vote on, and thousands of White Nationalists voted on the position statements. You can go to the link I gave above, and look in the 2nd post where he lists the statements. These statements can be considered as what &quot;White Nationalism&quot; is about. It is a folly and inaccuracy to think that &quot;White Nationalism&quot; doesn't imply a nation-state. Paul111 does not know what White Nationalism is, nor is he a White Nationalist himself. I am a White Nationalist and I've been with the movement for over 8 years, since 1998.   <LF>   To say that White Nationalism is not about creating a nation is like saying you like to go swimming without getting wet. It is stupendously illogical. The whole idea of White Nationalism is about creating a nation for Whites to live in. Wikipedia needs to reflect the truth and this article needs to be edited for accuracy. I have provided abundant evidence for my cas

We can certainly say that the majority of Stormfront voters support these proposals, but they are not necessarily a cross-section of Stormfront subscribers much less of the whole international White Nationalism movement. We all know that the validity of polls of this type is very low.

The polls do represent the general opinion of a majority of White Nationalists. And so does YGGDRASIL's WN FAQ. The majority of White Nationalists in the world do espouse the creation of a nation for Whites only. To mention White Nationalism without affirming the idea of a separate nation is slander and disinformation. If we picked at random any White Nationalist in the world, he or she would agree that this movement is about creating an all-White nation. This is common knowledge to anyone active in the movement. If you believe otherwise, I want to see evidence that the majority of White Nationalists don't espouse the idea of an all-White natio

I checked and none of the statements polled more than a couple of hundred votes. Please show me where you find &quot;thousands&quot; of responses. Also, since when is Stormfront the only WN forum?

I also added that is is difficult to judge the degree of support for any option. The only sources are forums and websites, and a 'movement' website might be the work of one individual. But given the amount of patriotic rhetoric, and the emphasis on the heritage of white ''Americans'', I think it is clear that most US white nationalists don't seek to abandon their ''American'' national identity in favour of  a giant White-o-stan.

This article is a disgrace to White Nationalism and Wikipedia's tradition of accuracy and non-biased factual information. White Nationalism does NOT equate to American nationalism. It has no &quot;American&quot; identity present. The desire to retain an &quot;American&quot; identity is ABSENT. We are not White American nationalists, we are WHITE Nationalists. An American identity would be present in American nationalism, not White Nationalism. Notice when you go to www.stormfront.org, look on the top-left of the window it says &quot;White Pride World Wide&quot; because White Nationalism is a worldwide movement, not an American one.  The request for a segregated &quot;Whites-only&quot; zone is not generally present either, most White Nationalists demand the creation of an entirely NEW nation for Whites only. A segregated Whites-only zone would be a logical stepping stone to an eventual White nation though. But it is not the main goal of White Nationalism. Also, White Nationalism is not &quot;White America&quot; politics. Show me evidence of the tradition of &quot;White-America&quot; politics. There may be a historical perspective and comparable traditions, but they do not relate to White Nationalism specifically. They are isolated events that bear no relationship to the current White Nationalist group. Anyone spending even a small amount on Stormfront will immediately realize what I'm saying. I am editing this travesty of an article to reflect accuracy and truth, rather than libel and slanderous disinformation. I encourage Paul111 and everyone else to go to this &quot;Beginners Guide to White Nationalism&quot; and scroll down to the &quot;White Nationalist Solution&quot; part and read the articles listed there. It will explain to you what White Nationalism is about. http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3247

Segregated zones are not a nation, and proposals for segregating the United States are not in themselves a proposal to create a new nation.

Where is your evidence that we only demand segregation within the USA? Most White Nationalists, if not all, demand the creation of a NEW nation for Whites only. Spend a few minutes around on Stormfront and you will quickly get the evidence you need. Why do you insist on this inaccurate description of White Nationalism on Wikipedia is beyond me. Can you at least back up your &quot;claims&quot; with some evidence? Why am I the only one providing evidence? Dr. William Pierce and his articles are widely-read by White Nationalists throughout the country. It takes only a minute to understand the White Nationalist movement. The fact that you still haven't understood it is a testament to your stupidity. I already provided ample evidence with the White Nationalist Position Statements which were voted on by hundreds of people PER position, so if we add up the hundreds, we get thousands of votes for the complete position statement. If you don't think thousands of votes is enough evidence, then there is something wrong with you. It is your turn to provide evidence for your claim now.

So do most other white nationalists in the USA. There is no evidence that a majority of white nationalists have abandoned their national identity as ''Americans''. The fact that they seek to [[racial segregation|segregate]] the United States does not make them a separate nation. In discussing [[nation]]s, [[nation-states]], and [[nationalism]], this article should use acepted terminology, and also match the usage at those three articles. The fact that a group of white Americans want to live in a whites-only zone does not, in itself, make them a 'white nation'. The section on relationship to nationalism does note, that a fully-segregated state would no longer be a nation-state, since the national unity has disappeared.   <LF>   :Online polls at one forum are not evidence, and the voter totals can not be added up since the same people may be voting in successive polls. Additionally, sources quoted by [[User:Osmium14|Osmium14]] often contradict the interpretation he gives to them. For instance, the White Nationalist FAQ by 'Yggdrasil' explicitly identifies white nationalists as European-Americans, and proposes the segregation of the United States by [[Congressional district]]s. It does not state that whites are non-Americans, and it does not identify a new territorial homeland for them. The suggestion that most US white nationalists have ceased to feel American, and are prepared to withdraw from the United States and leave it to non-whites, is inherently unlikely. With a few exceptions, the reverse seems true: they think whites are the real Americans, and that non-whites don't belong there. I suggest that users who are interested in this issue read the articles on [[Basque nationalism]] and [[Breton nationalism]], as examples of what a separatist nationalist movement entails.

If you need further evidence that we demand the creation of a new nation, whether using existing territory from the USA or not does not matter, it is a new nation for Whites only. There is NO EVIDENCE that the majority of White Nationalists demand to live in a &quot;segregated Whites-only&quot; zone within the United States. The author Carol Swain, a black female, has written a book on WN. Her book is called &quot;The New White Nationalism...&quot; and also another book from her is &quot;Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America.&quot; These books have quotes from the leading White Nationalists such as Jared Taylor, Don Black, David Duke, and others. The whole point of the movement of White Nationalism is for the creation of a White nation. Your links to Basque nationalism and Breton nationalism are irrelevant! We have a common saying in WN, it is &quot;Our Race is Our Nation,&quot; and this means the rejection of any form of &quot;American&quot; identity. 'Yggdrasil' states in his FAQ in the 2nd question and 1st question that WNs intend to create our own nation,    <LF>   Q. What is White Nationalism?   <LF>   A. The idea that Whites may need to create a separate nation as a means of defending themselves.   <LF>   Q. Do White Nationalists feel they are superior to other races?   <LF>   A. No. The desire of White Nationalists to form their own nation has nothing to do with superiority or inferiority.   <LF>   http://www.stormfront.org/whitenat.htm   <LF>   I do not agree with some parts of his FAQ (such as a new nation for Whites and a segregated zone for Asians within the &quot;White nation), and this FAQ is old, from 1994 I presume from what I can remember. The White Nationalist Position Statements are better suited as the almost near-perfect opinion of White Nationalists everywhere. I have private messaged Don Black, David Duke, and others about the WN position statements. Also, 'Yggdrasil' posted in the thread for the original position statements.

You make the example that a person with &quot;black&quot; features but white skin as a result of albinism would not be necessarily seen as truly &quot;white&quot; by most people. This claim may have some ground. Perhaps some physical features outside of skin color could preclude a non-white person from being seen as white. But what about a white being person being seen as a non-white? Hypothetically, what if there was a &quot;white&quot; person (&quot;white&quot; meaning physcial features save skin color) with black or very dark skin? I think there is no doubt such a person would be viewed as black, regardless of skull shape, bone structure, intelligence, behavior, etc. In fact, I personally know a few people who are biracial (black-white) and have very dark skin yet their other physical features (at least facial structures) are more like their white parent. These people, at least in the view of most, are black . . . no one ever sees them as white in any way, shape, or form (no pun intended). I have my own reasons for believing why this is the case, but I won't go into them here! That would be another debate.   <LF>   ::::Just to better show of my point, let's take Halle Berry. She is described by many as an &quot;African-American&quot; actress. In fact, she is biracial, half white and half African-American. I think (let me stress the I THINK as this is in no way scientific!) her physical features, outside of skin color, could be described as mostly &quot;white&quot;. But because her skin color is darker and because she is known to be biracial, people label her as African-American.   <LF>   ::::Also, I don't know if the albinism photos are completely fair. The skin color caused by the disorder is extreme; most white people do not have skin nearly so light (myself included). Niether, in the same way, is the hair color of albinos common amongst white people. Therefore, at least in part, these abnormalities of course cause albinos to look &quot;weird&quot;.   <LF>   ::::Just food for thought! Please respond . .

Taken as a whole, these nationalist arguments reiterated the allegiance to whiteness, valorized the segregationist social solidarity through which whiteness was constructed, and reconciled the violence of slavery as its legitimate expression. '''For the vast majority of white Americans, white freedom, white supremacy, and the concept of a &quot;white nation&quot; were all one idea, one national ethos.'''   <LF>   &quot;This national ethos would inhabit the most banal of social pronouncements. For instance, in arguing against abolition in 1836, Senator Leigh of Virginia mentioned white mob riots against the black communities of Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and New York, and asked what worse social disorder would have erupted bad there been general emancipation (Horsman, 1981: 209). There was no thought of charging the white mobs with criminal behavior, or bringing their instigators to justice. In his view, the white mobs were simply demonstrating the Anglo-Saxon propensity to dominate and enslave other races. Whites who argued for emancipation were the real outlaws and traitors for advocating what would have fomented even greater mob violence. In short, for Leigh, black people should be enslaved for their own good, so that good civilized white folks would be spared the necessity of mob barbarity.   <LF>   &quot;'''This &quot;nationalist ethos&quot; even infected the antislavery arguments of the several antislavery parties in the North and Midwest (those that would later coalesce into the Republican Party). Though they argued that slavery was morally wrong, it was because it produced inequality among whites, not because it was inhuman toward blacks.''' Slave owners had a decided social and political advantage over non-owners, by wealth and the votes they controlled. In addition, white workers were at a disadvantage where slave labor could be employed in the same jobs more cheaply, thereby reducing overall labor conditions. These parties managed to get slavery gradually abolished in the North, after which they contented themselves with obstructing slavery's extension to the new territories. Nevertheless, they ultimately supported black disenfranchisement in both areas. In effect, antislavery was predicated on white supremacy rather than on human dignity and human rights. Only the radical abolitionists considered the humanity of the bond-laborers--which sometimes meant calling nationalism itself in question. For instance, against white nationalism, William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) proposed his &quot;disunion&quot; thesis, and attempted to articulate the construction of a different form of nation altogether...&quot;   <LF>   The cultural roots of interventionism in the U.S. Social Justice March 22, 20

The groups discussed in the article seem to be newer groups which expressly call themselves &quot;White Nationalist.&quot; The KKK is not linked from this page, although it is from the KKK page to here. As far as earliest origins go, I would honestly mention the fact that the United States of America was very explicit in the Naturalization Act of 1790, saying only &quot;free white persons&quot; of &quot;good moral character&quot; could become citizens. That sounds like &quot;White Nationalism&quot; to me. That was more or less strictly adhered to until the 1868 14th Amendment. Even then, the Bhagat Thind case in 1923 determined that non-whites still could not become naturalized citizens. At any rate, the 1790 act must be the first example of being &quot;White&quot; as a crucial determinant of citizenship in world history. That has to count for something on this topic.    <LF>   Also, should we really be including German National Socialism under this topic? Certainly race played a central role in NS ideology and citizenship, but the emphasis was quite different. I'd be hesitant to include any European nationalist movements under the category &quot;White Nationalism&quot; because they are typically much more focused on their individual ethnic designations. On the other hand, Rockwell's American Nazi Party should be included since it's basically old-fashioned White Nationalism with the added inspiration from NS Germany. In general, I think it'd be worthwhile to have separate headings for the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa and describe the various past and present manifestations of White Nationalism in the said countries.

Also, groups that are pro-(insert native European ethnic group), anti-multiculturalism, AND acknowledge common bonds with other Europeans...doesn't = WNism, though I see how it can get muddled.

I expect all 3 of those people might fit here, but do we have any source at all saying that they are &quot;notable white nationalists&quot;?

If you're familiar with the topic, I wouldn't revert their addition, but I think it's generally a bad precedent to set adding content without sources, so I'd strongly prefer to see a citation first (ideally one added to their article).

The practical effect of following that route has led to the situation where Scalise was recently claimed to have spoken to a &quot;White Supremacist&quot; organization, when a look at an archive for the EURO website clearly shows that neither &quot;supremacist&quot; nor &quot;separatist&quot; goals are espoused.  (Where those news organizations got the WS label is a mystery.)  For that matter, I'm hard-pressed to even justify labelling EURO as being &quot;white nationalist&quot;:  What does that mean?  If a person is white, but he isn't a supremacist, and he isn't a separatist, what exactly is he?  He's just &quot;white&quot;, right?

At some point days before Dec 27, 2014, a liberal noticed a long-ignored fact:  Stephen Scalise had attended a meeting, originally thought to have been a meeting of EURO, although days it was later understood to be a meeting of a different organization in the same Hotel, a few hours before.  Smelling political blood, an organization (&quot;Occupy Democrats&quot;) sent out a press release, announcing that Scalise attended a &quot;white supremacist organization&quot; meeting. After reading dozens of such media articles, I saw that none of them actually justified or explained by EURO constituted a &quot;white supremacist&quot; organization. (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/06/what-we-know-about-steve-scalise-attending-white-p/)  In that context, the term &quot;white supremacist&quot; seems to have been used primarily as an epithet, and for that having a consistent definition wasn't considered necessary.   <LF>   ::::Apparently this press release prominently contained the words &quot;white supremacist&quot;, so over the next week or so hundreds of media organizations following that lead began to declare EURO a &quot;white supremacist&quot; organization, when they had apparently never so-labelled EURO before.

Some WP editors, on [[WP:European-American Unity and Rights Organization]] have actually had the temerity to claim that these hundreds of references to &quot;white supremacist&quot; EURO are evidence of &quot;consensus&quot;.

None of these sources say that white nationalism is the same as nazism.

Either real or not. And therefore I don't understand why you have nazism on this page. When the sources aren't valid, I don't need to give you sources.

It is true that nationalism in general is (at least in theory) not the same as supremacism, chauvinism, [[ethnic nationalism]], or ethnocentrism, it's just that supremacists use &quot;nationalism&quot; as a euphemism (and nationalists tend towards some kind of supremacist ideology in practice, rarely being satisfied with their ostensible goals), just like &quot;patriot&quot; is a typical euphemism. White nationalism in particular, as a race-based &quot;pan-movement&quot; (striving to unite the whole &quot;white race&quot;), is a completely different beast from &quot;normal&quot; nationalism.

In general, it can refer to liking to watch people in any normally private setting, which can be a sexual sort of voyeurism, but can also be something akin to living vicariously by watching someone else's life.  (A few films, such as ''[[Monsieur Hire]]'', have portrayed this latter sort of voyeurism.)

The folk/lever harp, while used quite a lot for folk and traditional music, is also a harp played by people who may have no or little  interest in folk music. Musicians who cannot afford a pedal harp, those who prefer the smaller sizes and different timbres, and so on. (Such as myself. I do actually happen to know a fair amount about Celtic history and music, I simply prefer to play classical music on my Celtic-butt   <LF>   ''''' lever harp. Musicology studied at university, great personal interest, etc etc.) It is wise to acknowledge in a public article discussing modern harping that the small harp is not &quot;just&quot; for folk/traditional/Celtic music. Many people do not realise that they don't have to have a pedal harp to play non-folk music, and often get the impression that the small harp is not a &quot;real&quot; harp.    <LF>   The language has been tidied up also.

I can imagine a [[piano]] or a [[hammered dulcimer]], for example, being described as a &quot;string-percussion&quot; instrument (though I don't think I've ever seen it done), because their strings are hammered. But with the harp, they're just plucked, so it doesn't seem to make much sense.
6229	6226	12	9	0	44707	44707	6226	-1	-1	1258	0	Dreamyshade	0	-1	I've always thought of a harp as a string-percussion instrument just because it is plucked. It is a stringed instrument, but it's not in the &quot;string&quot; family (with violins and basses and things). To me, plucking is a percussive movement: pulling the string and releasing it to create a sound. I've heard pianos described as &quot;string-percussion&quot;, too, since they have strings and are hammered (similar to plucking). Other than &quot;string-percussion&quot;, I don't know how to classify the harp/piano family, and that term doesn't seem to be widely spread.
6230	6226	13	9	0	44707	44707	6226	-1	-1	405	0	Camembert	0	-1	You're right that trying to classify instruments is a troublesome thing - it has been the central subject of a number of books. &quot;[[Percussion_instrument|percussion]] instruments&quot;, however, are usually defined as &quot;something which makes noise by being struck&quot;, and plucked instruments are not usually put in that class. &quot;String instrument&quot; is an awkward term, because classical musicians sometimes use it to mean only orchestral strings (violin, viola, cello, double bass), but it's also used to mean ''any'' instrument which makes sound through vibrating strings, so it's the term we should use here, I think.
6231	6226	14	9	0	44707	44707	6226	-1	-1	1258	0	Dreamyshade	0	-1	I wonder if we should just call the harp a chordophone. It's stringed and somewhat percussive, but neither orchestra strings nor percussion. When it has to be classified (in instrument books and things), I've seen it as &quot;strings&quot;, but never &quot;percussion&quot;. If we called it a chordophone, we could put &quot;([[string instrument]])&quot; in there next to it. This way, I think it would clarify that the harp isn't with the &quot;orchestral strings&quot;, but that it's a stringed instrument.

It never was &quot;plucked&quot;. Plucking a harp in fact is bad for your fingers, you still want to strike it, even if you call it plucking. Definitely a &quot;string-percussion&quot; instrument before it got degraded to a glissando machine in the modern orchestra. (actually, I guess &quot;glissando machine&quot; would also count as &quot;percussion&quot;.) In the orchestra it is most often grouped with percussion and other odd instruments such as the Celesta.

The harp definitely did not originate in Ireland (maybe the European harp did). There are pictures of harps from old Egypt. Harps are widespread in Africa (it is necessary to include more of that in the article). The title of [[Kubik, Gerhard]] [http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-8258-7800-7 Zum Verstehen afrikanischer Musik, AufsÃ¤tze, Reihe: Ethnologie: Forschung und Wissenschaft, Bd. 7, 2., aktualisierte und ergÃ¤nzte Auflage, 2004, 448 S., ISBN 3-8258-7800-7]   <LF>   shows a picture with a harp player from the Tassili mountains in the Sahara. This picture has been dated to about 800 - 700 b.C. I don't know if the harp is of Asian or African origin, but it is definitely not a European invention. In Africa, one finds a possible line of development starting with hunting bows used as [[Musical bows]] and continuing with Musical bows with resonators (like the Berimbau of Brazil) to bow harps, so the harp might well be of African origin.

But there were other celtic peopels in present day Scotland too, one of these being the Picts.    <LF>   In Scotland, the images of triangular harps appeared first about the 9th century, on the east coast, in Pictish stone carvings. Later carvings are found further west, and show a gradual development toward the advanced form of the oldest surviving Gaelic harps, which date from the 15th century.   <LF>   Pictish harp carved on sandstone cross at Dupplin Castle, Perthshire. Late 9th or early 10th century. After J. Romily Allen, Early Christian Monuments of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1903, fig. 334B   <LF>   &quot;In Ireland, however, images of David carved on the high crosses (10th century) sandstone cross at Durrow Abbey, Co. Offaly, Ireland) show quadrangular instruments, possibly lyres. The earliest Irish images of a triangular harp do not appear until later: in metal, on an 11th century reliquary , and in stone in the 12th century.&quot;   <LF>   Therefore Ireland could not have invented the triangular celtic harp, because of its use of the lyer at this time and its spread through non-Gaelic culture of the Picts to the Scots.   <LF>   The oldest term in Irish for the Harp is the &quot;cruit&quot;, crom-chruit, the gaelic Irish called the Picts the Cruit or Chuid. This also may be a link to the origins of the harp.   <LF>   Until you come up with (factual) archaeological proof, then stop second guessing. I have asked experts in both the national museums of Scotland and Irelands Trinity college, both say the same. The triangular harp common to both Scotland and Ireland originated with the Picts on present day Scottish east coast and spread west and eventually to Ireland.   <LF>   You are right though harping has existed in Ireland for over a thousand of years, but the non-pedal, triangular style celtic harp of today originated in scotlands east coast, so we just cannot airbrush these origins away too.   <LF>   Also read these articles on the web:   <LF>   http://www.silcom.com/~vikman/isles/scriptorium/harps/harps.html   <LF>   http://www.alisonvardy.com/harp-info/medieval-harp-history.htm   <LF>   http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/ce082202.html   <LF>   and    <LF>   http://www.clarsach.net/Bill_Taylor/traditional.htm   <LF>   If you have anything to add feel free.

It is in fact highly possible, and widely thought amongst scholars that the Picts did invent the clarsach. If you have this 600AD evidence, please post it.

That been said, the first historic evidence of the triangular harp comes from Babylonia, where one was found in circa 1920, and a very nice looking harp indeed. It dates from about 2500 BC.

It is depicted on many Pictish stones, the dating of some perhaps very early. This clarsach was part of Pictish musical culture, and there is no reason to think they imported it from the Irish or Scottish Gaels, other than later affinity that the Irish have for this harp. The NPOV assessment is that the Picts had the clarsach, others had it too. Linking these by cause and effect is purely speculative, although it is interesting that the earliest Gaelic word for the harp is almost identical for their word for a Pict. Also, it should be made clear that the Picts were probably making use of the Gaelic language from an early date (the evidence that the Pictish kings spoke Pictish is nil BTW). The inscription on the Dupplin cross lists the name of a Pictish king (CausantÃ­n mac Fergusa) in Latin with Gaelic orthography; two languages were used in Pictland to write inscriptions, Latin and Old &quot;Irish&quot;. So the potential for transmission was high. Irish sources also list something called the &quot;Pictish metre&quot;, a poetic form of Gaelic originating in Pictland which was probably accompanied by a musical instrument. The form was notable, and it is possible that it came into Irelan with the clarsach ... but like I said, this is speculation.  - '''[[User:Calgacus|Calgacus]] (''[[User talk:Calgacus|ÎšÎ‘Î›Î“Î‘ÎšÎŸÎ£]]'')''' [[Image:UW_Logo-secondary.gif|15px]]

They were not immune to the Christian pill so to speak, as their southern Brythonic neighbors in Strathclyde were already becoming Christian at this time. The earliest Brythonic language reference dates from just before St Augustine set foot on Britain, and the poems of Aneirin's â€œY Gododdinâ€ (in present day Edinburgh) bear testimony to the fact that Christianity was by then long established amongst the native British celts.   <LF>   Although Columba gets the lionâ€™s share of credit for bringing Christianity to Scots, there were missionaries before him.

The cross until lately was classed as a Gaelic cross, and it carries obvious gaelic design. Then recently, maybe for nationalistic reasons, some are classing it as a Pictish carving, but not all Scots agree with that analysis. Very often the 'Dupplin harp' carving is pictorially misrepresented in drawings. My basic premise is that the triangular harp was not first used by the Picts, (who left no language or history), but originated in Mediterranean area and Middle East. Later, I believe that the harp was brought to Alba (now Scotland), by Gael (Irish) settlers in the first millenium AD. A bit more expertise needed, and a little less rant please!

The proof you have given is inconclusive. Celtic knot work is not exclusively Irish as seen in the Sutton Hoo treasure hoard and was noted by Calgacus. You talk about the Dupplin cross 830 AD being the only evidence we have. This is interesting, as any Irish stone pictorial evidence dates from the 9th to 10th centuaries. The later stones show an east/west migration from a non-Gaelic society to a Gaeltachta.   <LF>   The so called written proof you have given is flawed by translations, second guessing and similar cultural biases. As Calgacus said you havenâ€™t made a case at all, and you are bias towards the archaeological data,and blinded by your own nationalistic reasons. Yes, harping did exist in ancient Ireland. I have never disputed this. But the celtic harp may not have originated from there. Irish evidence be it pictorial or from written sources is so far inconclusive, and is post Pictish in nature. Your argument towards the Pictish stones being of Gaelic origins are insulting to the carvers as the ancient Picts were masters of stone carving, which is evident by the Brochs and Neolithic settlements so far discovered.   <LF>   Not only did the Picts have to deal with the Romans, they also had their homelands taken away by the Irish Gaels, seeking lands beyond their own. So not all interactions were peaceful. Influence is a two way process good or bad. Iâ€™ll leave out the ranting if you drop the hostility towards anything celtic which is non-Gaelic in cultur

Because we have never physically seen one of these (8th, 9th and 10th) centaury harps, all we can do is speculate on an instrument that has evolved from ancient times. Itâ€™s all down to the original artists interpretation/skill etc in carving the monument in stone or later in metal.    <LF>   Sea horn, saying that the Scots are trying to take the celtic harp for themselves or their own nationalistic tendencies is bordering on the ridiculous. The celtic harp was the national symbol of Scotland from ancient times to the 16th centaury. So even if they wanted to claim the harp back as their own they can. As for the harp being exclusively Irish, well its still the welsh national instrument too.    <LF>   Considering that the Pictish carving and the metal Irish one is separated by 300 years and that thin metal work is a lot easier to carve than a huge block of stone your argument for the T-piller is inconclusive. The pictish carving could have had a T-pillar and the artist wasnâ€™t that good, or the Irish artist was better at his metal carving.   <LF>   As an afterthought, the Babylonian harps are not classified as true harps, but harp lyres.

Oh Calgacus, you do rant ever so much about the Picts (who left no history or language), you are so selective in what you want to believe, and you are stating those beliefs as facts.

Having the same access as you to this page, I'm well aware that harps existed before the Picts. But according to the Ross article, no harp is attested between 400 BC and the appearance of Pictish harps in the early middle ages. You have to admit, taking stone evidence alone is suggesting that the Picts did have the harp before the Irish or Scottish Gaels; that's just the evidence I'm afraid. I didn't manufacture the evidence. Of course there is loads of room for doubt about the conclusion that the Picts gave the Gaels their clarsach, and I myself am reserved; stone evidence merely reflects what the sculptures and their patrons decided to put on the stones, and it is notable that on most of those Pictish stones with the harp on it there is Davidian kingship imagery. I don't know what that means, but maybe if Irish patrons were pursuing the same goal they would have put in a harpist; who knows. But the evidence is what it is. If you really believe that all claims that the Picts gave the Gaels the harp is anti-Irishness, then send an email to historians such as John Bannerman, and tell them your thoughts. If not, calm down, be nice, and give people the benefit of the doubt; if you do that, you'll have a more sophisticated idea of what is actually going on in this discussion, and maybe you'll even concede that the Pictish theory has something going for it, other than appeasing the nationalism of a dead people. - '''[[User:Calgacus|Calgacus]] (

I wrote, and this is my belief from some years of reading on this matter, that the triangular harp came from the Middle East to Ireland by at least 500 AD, or even by 500 BC, and later it came to Scotland with the Gaels.  If I have any problem about what you wrote, it is this.  You rubbished almost everything I wrote, you denied that a Babylonian triangular existed and you used some of what I wrote, to my horror, to make an attack on the history of another country.

You seem to think I denied its existence; in which case, read what I've written, and you'll see that I didn't. Why don't you stick to the things I actually say, rather than the things you invent for me to say. BTW, I attacked the history of no country. This is another one of your convenient inventions. You're entitled to your beliefs and all, but that ain't good enough for wikipedia. Men like Ross and Bannerman have done more work on the subject than you, and are professional historians who have possessed academic salaries for years, and in the case of Bannerman, is one of the most highly respected men in his field. Anyways, even if you're correct that the harp spread to Ireland from Mesopotamia, it still has to come via Britain, as indeed does everything else (coming via Spain is the product of medieval beliefs that Ireland was close to Spain; but in fact it isn't, the sea route is far too treacherous, and all recorded Irish travellers from the Middle Ages reach the continent via Britain); the two easiest sailing between Britain and Ireland are the Rhinns of Galloway and Argyll, both in Scotland (examine the travels of St Malachy and the Papal legate, who reach the continent, or Ireland from the continent, via Galloway). In any case, your theory flies against the sculptural evidence and indeed literary evidence. The only way to get around it is by Gaelicizing the Picts at an early date, which is arguable; but it still doesn't explain the idea that Ireland '''must''' have possessed it before the Picts. True Ireland is later associated with the harp, but that accounts for nothing except later history. If you're going only on evidence, the Picts seem to have had it earlier. This doesn't mean they actually did have it earlier, but it does mean that one has to come up with some good reasoning as to why the Irish might have had it earlier. - '''[[User:Calgacus|Calgacus]] (

If there were Irish stones pre 9th centaury with triangular harp reliefs, we wouldnâ€™t be having this discussion. Notice I use the word discussion, and I would be fiercely defending the Irish position or another carving for that matter.   <LF>   Sea horn, your pictorial data for the triangular harp, is somewhat different from the one I have found, one with Sir. Leonard Woolley holding the instrument. Although when I say holding I do mean it in the (broadest possible sense). What he is holding is a plaster cast of a harp/lyre or as its more commonly known â€œthe Harp of Ur, although it is more commonly called a lyre. The original harp/lyre rotted away some millennia ago, so itâ€™s not the original instrument and Sir Leonard Woolley poured plaster of Paris into the imprint.   <LF>   Your picture omits the characteristic sound box with distinct calf/bull decoration. In this picture the instrument does have this relief. So baring that in mind, the picture I have here is the original interpretation Sir. Leonard Woolley found.   <LF>   If the picture fails to load or is too small, click on this link at your perusal; Calgacus if you could load this picture Iâ€™d be grateful as Iâ€™m not that good with computers.   <LF>   http://www.scottishstudies.com/920oorclub.htm   <LF>   http://www.lyre-of-ur.com/pdf/BBCNews.pdf    <LF>   The harp/lyre clearly shows a sound box and four distorted arms, this instrument is classified as a lyre because itâ€™s not triangular in shape. The confusion arises (as far as I can see), when people look at the instrument and include the supporting pillar as part of the soundbox. The wood must have warped over time and the plaster poured into the hole. A true harp would never have this.   <LF>   Other types of vague triangular shaped harp/lyres have existed, although these canâ€™t be classified as a true triangular harps in the celtic or concert examples we have today. For more information look at;   <LF>   http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/hsc21b.htm   <LF>   They were played on the knee or held and strummed with the fingers. The Irish instruments up till the 11th century show this style of instrument. The Pictish instrument is much different; it stretches from the playerâ€™s ear directly to the floor, with the strings running vertical and the soundbox running the full length of the harp, from ear to floor. This is more characteristic of the celtic harp of today, than the harp of Ur or the Irish reliefs.   <LF>   Yes triangular &quot;of sort&quot; harp/lyres have existed, I donâ€™t dispute this I welcome this evidence. But the Pictish instrument is quite different. If my data is wrong then weâ€™ll discuss the evidence.    <LF>   Lastly, I value your comments positive or negative in this discussion, but bear in mind keep this conversation clean and we all can discuss the data as an intellectual rather than a nationalistic, demeaning, or confrontational manne

I added it so I could show you where your confusion lies. Its rounded chest shape at best, triangular of sorts but not a true harp.    <LF>   As I have said before;   <LF>   â€œOne of the key points of the Pictish harp is the sound box runs the full length of the instrument and that the strings diminish in size and increase in tone up the scale of the instrument. It is more characteristic of the modern clairsach and concert harp. It is the first instrument with a T-pillar. This is why its distinguished from lyres and harp/lyres, and is the oldest credible record in existence.â€   <LF>   The Greek instrument has none of this. Its strings are all the same length and at best it has a strumming sound. All I have proven is that a triangular lyre or harp/lyre existed in antiquity. It is about as far removed from a clairsach as you can get. As for the argument for the lyre of Ur as proof, itâ€™s a plaster cast of a bent lyre. Its box shaped, the reconstruction by academics has proves this.   <LF>

I have rarely come across such nationalistic arrogance.      <LF>   Highland Scottish and Pictish culture enthusiasts have to do some serious reflection on the origin of Highland Scottish tradition. Trevor Roper in his research suggests that the Highlands of Scotland were culturally deprived, and that the literature of the Highland Scot was a crude echo of the Irish literature. Trevor Roper claims also that the bards of the Scottish chieftains came from Ireland, and that the Scottish bards were the &quot;rubbish of Ireland&quot; who were periodically cleared from Ireland and deposited in that convenient wasteland, Scotland. Also, according to Trevor Roper, while Ireland remained culturally an historic nation, Scotland developed, at best, as its poor sister. He further claims that Scotland did not develop an independent Scottish tradition.

Was not [[The Dagda]] an old Pictish god in ancient Ireland.  Surely that would support your passionate theory that the Picts invented the triangular harp, and did you know that Ireland had Picts too. Also, the ancient name in old Gaelic Ireland for a lyre was Cruit, please check your history.

Your rude rant would have worked much better if you had known what you were talking about. Firstly, theory is not mine, it is a standard academic belief. Many people here, for whatever reason, have tried to portray it as revisionist, but it's actually quite orthodox. Secondly, Cruit was the name for a harp, and if you doubt that, you should publish an article about it, coz medieval Gaelic spezialists are under this impression. - '''[[User:Calgacus|Calgacus]] (

His passionate theory as you say is actually backed up by empirical data and current theory surrounding the origins of the celtic harp. Experts say no triangular harp can be found in pre-10th century Ireland or the Gaels of Scotland for that matter. The evidence of the Dagda having the harp in written record is no clear indication of the type of instrument used. The common misconception is that just because the written record states a harp, doesnâ€™t really mean that the harp was a triangular harp.    <LF>   Roslyn Rench, The Harp (1969): Its History, Technique and Repertoire. Garden city press Ltd. Letchworth marked, Hertfordshire, UK.    <LF>   â€œLyres are often confused with harps in literature. The word psaltery, lyre and harp are often confused with one another and both come from the word to pluck a stringed instrument. The best we can hope to do then is note what instruments are depicted in their art and ignore the written record.â€   <LF>   She also states that the appearance of a column made the advent of the modern harp first appeared in Ross, Scotland in the 8th century.   <LF>   Written records are not clear enough, they are not accurate and do not depict the instrument used. Thatâ€™s why the experts donâ€™t take the Irish myth cycles seriously as the data is flawed. Furthermore there are no harp depictions in Ireland till the 10th century.   <LF>   Stokes (1954): Music and letters.

Harper Collins publishers.   <LF>   Quote:   <LF>   â€œThe earliest descriptions of a triangular framed harp i.e. harps with a fore pillar are found on 8th century Pictish stones. Pictish harps were strung from horsehair. The instruments apparently spread south to the Anglo Saxons who commonly used gut strings and then west to the Gaels of the Highlands and to Ireland. The first credible written record of the word Clarsach or (Clar Shioleach) willow board, first appears in the writings of Giolla Brighde Albanach a Scottish bard who lived in the 11th century.â€   <LF>   It appears that the Irish and Scottish Gaels used the lyre and that the Pictish harp spread to them. I agree with you though, the ancient name in old Gaelic for a lyre was Cruit, but you forgot to mention that the Old Irish Gaelic for Clarsach was also Cruit.   <LF>

Academics agree that the lyre was well established in Ireland but the harp was not. As Calgacus says this train of thought is quite orthodox and excepted and is backed up with archaeological data. The shape of an instrument be it triangular, quadrangular or polyangular is actually very important. Academics agree harp in Irish literature is well documented but just how serious we can take this, as a credible empirical source is a different matter. As for Scotland claiming the celtic harp, thatâ€™s just laughable. The matter of the Scots not having a description to say what the harps depicted in sculpture were actually like, well the Picts did some three hundred years before and its even noted that they used gut strings. Really what IS all the fuss here? The Gaels i.e. Irish (including myself) and the Scots (including yourself) lose out on this argument.

For now, I have modified both copies the same way - but it does bring up the question about the supposed bias of this article, because it does seem to treat the modern concert harp in disproportionate detail, and also the much shorter &quot;Pedal harp&quot; article is ostensibly about the same harp, with some content duplicated.   <LF>   I thought it may be a bit confusing to have some detail about this harp in one article, and some in the other, and it brings to mind this thought: Why not shift some of the finer detail about this harp to the &quot;Pedal harp&quot; article, and let this &quot;Harp&quot; article give a description of this harp in just about the same level of detail as it treats the other harps?  Duplicated content (such as the description of the pedal system) would go in just one article, whichever one was considered most suitable for that level of detail.   <LF>   It would be a bit fiddly and time-consuming to do this properly, but I think it's worth considering.

I'm afraid the only credible evidence of an Irish triangular harp image comes from the Madoc book cover so I will need a cited reference of an Irish image to credit your comment. Also the edit you have added to cites Pictish stones reference includes an Irish manuscript as the oldest European evidence for a triangular harp. This reference has been taken out of context as the cited source does not include ANY Irish source images as there are none. Until you source a credible image from a pre-9th century source I will place a {{Fact|date=July 2008}} tag on your edit. You may however be getting mixed up with the Lyre being confused with the Anglo-Saxon Harp or Harpa as the cruit in Ireland which was used in Ireland until the 12th century. Some experts even think the triangular harp HAS no connection in Ireland till the 11th century. I will need empirical data to remove the tag. Regar

I am aware and have read the article by Alasdair Ross to that all the Scottish (and by implication all the Irish) figures were copied from foreign drawings and not from life. I myself have also included that reference in the [[clarsach]] page so you have taken my edits out of context. Furthermore Ross cites his only evidence to support this comes from the utrecht palster which is 20 years younger than the Pictish harp stones and only arrived in the British isles some 100 years after its completion. So again there is no Irish source from this.    <LF>   I would also point out Alasdair Ross is quoted as saying in ''Pictish Chordophone Depictions. Alasdair Ross in Cambrian Medieval Celtic studies, 36, 1998, esp. p. 41.'' '''The harps depicted in Pictland are unique, and do not look like those depicted in later medieval Scotland or Ireland.''' So it looks like he contradicts himself, and in both cases does not state Ireland as the outside source of the Pictish instrument, so this does not back up you claims of an Irish providence for the carvings. Furthermore, it seems to me you are trying to Gaelicise the Picts as the only possibility reason of there being a triangular harp like in their culture. Also the assumption the Picts were a blank receivers is nil and not supported in empirical research. I would like a citation for the Pictish stones not being of Pictish manufacture by an expert for your own pov statement. The statement you put about the St John's Crucifixion Plaque is rather obscure as any empirical evidence I have seen, nor does the cite the plaque.   <LF>   Further from being motivated by nationalistic tendencies I am motivated by citations and credible empirical sources. I have researched Irish contemporary sources and you may find the following interesting although contradictory to your own views.   <LF>   ''The Ancient Music of Ireland Edward Bunting (2000) Curier Dover publications (originally published in 1843).'' From an Irish perspective, three distinct forms of lyre are evident; round top lyres as seen in the crosses at Ullard shows a quadrangular instrument with no forepillar.   <LF>   '''Recent introduction from Scotland to Ireland of the triangular harp or Clarsach.'''  in ''History Literature and music in Scotland 1700-1560 Russell Andrew McDonald 2002 University of Toronto Press, Arts Medieval.''   <LF>   ''Celtic Music History and Criticism Kenneth Mathieson 2001 Backbeat books p192.'' Only two quadrangular instruments occur within the Irish immigrant context on the west coast of Scotland and show the use of an Irish lyre. '''From this data it was apparent the triangular harp was present in Scotland before Ireland and the earliest harps used in Ireland were quadrangular ecclesiastical instruments'''.   <LF>   ''The Story of the Irish Harp its History and Influences Norah Joan Clark (2003) North Creek Press.'' '''The characteristic instrument of the Irish Celts was a U-shaped lyre''' and '''There is good evidence the triangular harp originated in Pictish Scotland rather than Ireland. The first true representation of an Irish triangular harp appears in the St. Mogue shrine.'''    <LF>   ''Music and the Celtic other world: from Ireland to Iona, Caren Ralles MacLeod (2000) Edinburgh University Press.'' Many such crosses in pre-Norman period '''in Ireland what is striking is that there are no triangular framed harps at all.

''Divided Gaels: Gaelic Cultural Identities in Scotland and Ireland c1200-1650.

And most strikingly of all other articles discuss the triangular harp was first appeared in Ireland at the start of the Anglo-Norman invasion.   <LF>   ''The Ancient Music of Ireland Edward Bunting (2000) Curier Dover publications (originally published in 1843).   <LF>   The Musical Times and Circular (1956) JASTOR Grey University of Michigan.   <LF>   Celtic Music History and Criticism Kenneth Mathieson 2001 Backbeat books p192.   <LF>   Fintan Vallely, ed (1999) The Companion to Irish Traditional Music New York University Press.   <LF>   A New History of Ireland, prehistoric and early history.

A view shared by his fellow academics, Tom Devine in his book Scotland and the Union 1707-2007 cites him as a â€œJhonny-come-latelyâ€ to the art of revisiting ancient stories, most of which have long since been disproved. Professor Devine critiques his approach: â€œHistorians have long gone past the stage of simply debunking myths,â€ he said. â€œIt's an easy thing to do, and frankly, it's rather an undergraduate activity.â€ Might I add he also called Africa â€œunhistoric&quot; like Scotland, was criticized by Africanists in various fields of academia. Michael Fry a noted historian, said: â€œI donâ€™t think Trevor-Roper is a very reliable guide to Scottish history.â€ In choosing Roper as the one size fits all view to white washing history, says more about your own anti-Scottish feelings and your pre-conceved ideas and bias.

The historians were lied to about the history of the diaries coming from East Germany from a reliable source. But old and all as Roper was, on further examination he quite quickly doubted the authenticity. It was not until forensics were done that the full fraud was uncovered.

However I feel the paragraph desperately needs editing to remove bias towards the Salzedo method.  This section portrays the French method as a stuffy outdated technique and paints the Salzedo method as the modern and therefore superior method of playing.  Both methods are equally viable for harpists, as technique is '''individual to the player'''.  The paragraph is heavily in praise of Salzedo and is '''not''' objective.  If another harpist can see their way to writing an unbiased [[Harp#Technique]] section they would be making the article more informative for prospective students and enthusiast

I've added information re the missing pedal mechanism on the lowest C&amp;D strings and (on most harps) on the highest G string.  The pedal harp mechanism is complicated enough, so this information usually gets left out when discussing how the pedals work, but that can lead to ambiguities re the harp's range.  Ideally I would like to replace the range illustration used here (C flat to G sharp) with the one used on the pedal harp page (C natural-D-natural to G natural) as a) we don't normally include scordatura options on other string instrument ranges and b) the illustration used on the pedal harp page has the benefit of pointing out that there is a missing semitone between the lower C and D strings however you tune them - but I see that there has already been discussion on this page re the range illustration, so I have left it as it is.  I've used Inglefield and Neill as a reference.   <LF>   I've also added some information re the use of the fifth finger under Modern European and American Instruments, with references.   <LF>   I've changed the mention of the upper middle to upper strings being made of nylon to &quot;either gut or nylon&quot; but I can't find a reference for this.  However, all my non-wire strings are gut, right to the top, and if you order Bow Brand strings, at least, you need to specify either gut or nylon for the upper registers.   <LF>   I've been relatively bold re the technique section.  I agree with the comment above re Salzedo bias, and I've cut out details of his biography, his playing and compositional style and harp designing etc, which don't really relate to technique, and added some examples of his theory.  I've also removed some bits from the French technique part - the thumb is not really low relative to the hand - it's still kept well above the rest of the hand - it's just low relative to the Salzedo technique.  I've also removed the reference to musical choices, which seems unfounded and inappropriate.  I haven't been so bold as to remove the section entirely, although I have some sympathy with StrumStrumandbeHanged's point above.  However, given the rancour that occasionally exists (particularly in the US) between different schools, it's likely that people might approach Wikipedia looking for information.   <LF>

The Teifi semi tone developed by Allan Shiers is a development from traditional mechanisms and nips up the string with two forks similarly to a concert harp. The semi tone is double locking for a full clear sound and does not wear the string. It is machined from solid brass and hardened steel and is adjustable by an eccentric roller to suit any gauge of string. In addition, the whole unit can be moved up or down to affect perfect pitch and string alignment. The lever arms are coloured for ease of note recognition and two sizes are made to suit treble, mid and bass.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>

You will not find that many positive links on any other voting system article. So I picked a few to delete. The deBorda one was probably the wrong one. I apologize for editing rashly - I'm not going to defend that particular edit.   <LF>   I don't want an edit war with you. It was nice to temporarily be on the same side as you about Hermitage's links, but you started going too far, making edits that served no purpose except to attack or thwart Hermitage. I was also trying to show that my goals for the voting systems pages don't just apply to new users: Hermitage complained that the external links for Borda are excessively slanted, and he was right, so I started doing something about it. The only thing that makes this an &quot;edit war&quot; with you is that the links were added by you, and you are protective of them. - RSpeer   <LF>   I am not against you.  I am glad to see that there are other folks who care about voting methods and selecting the methods that are appropriate to the needs of a circumstance.  If you want to do that as part of your career, I wish you great success in that.  It is a skill that is badly needed. I hope you understand that.   <LF>   The links I have posted are published peer-reviewed articles.  Yes, most of them present favorable conclusions   <LF>   about the BC, but some of them prove that the BC has vulnerabilities.  The voting systems page links usually go to websites that have general information or research articles on voting systems in general.  We need to impose standards for links which I think should be advocacy organizations for a particular method and primary, published and peer-reviewed research on the method or comparing the method to others. Otherwise, we open the door to anyone putting up a stupid pro or con vanity site into the links and just adding clutter to the article.  I am as protective of this article as you are of what you edit, but like you, I am willing and grateful for others to responsibly edit.  They usually do a good job.  Usually.     <LF>   You are perhaps aware that theoretical vulnerabilities are not the same as what occurs in practice.  The BC is used in real elections and I have not found complaints from any parties involved with them.  Hermitage's concluding comment in his BC article, which is not pub'd and peer-rv'd, contradicts actual experience with this method.  It is simply shoddy scholarship.  I have respect and regard for the academic process.  Occasionally it censors a radical innovation, but more often it weeds out slipshod scholarship and overt bias.  I welcome any con BC articles that are published and peer-reviewed to be added to the links.

For example, Dennis Mueller (who has many favorable things to say about Borda) writes ''&quot;The Borda count's Achilles' heel is commonly felt to be its vulnerability to strategic behavior (Pattanaik 1974; M. Sen, 1984).&quot;'' Opinions may differ on the severity of Borda's vulnerability, but certainly the issue should be represented significantly within the article.   <LF>   F451 advocates the Borda count, and such is obviously his right, but his pro-Borda opinions should not cause him to edit the tactical voting section down to a tiny stub.   <LF>   The following sentence was written by RSpeer on

On 08:32, 12 July 2005, I modestly expanded the tactical voting section, and included a re-worded version of RSpeer's example, as follows:   <LF>   :&quot;''For example, if there are two candidates whom a voter considers to be the most likely to win, the voter can maximize the power of his or her vote by ranking the more-preferred of the two candidates in first place, and ranking the less-preferred of the two candidates in last place, thus potentially employing both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many voters employ such strategies, then the result will no longer reflect the sincere preferences of the electorate.''&quot;   <LF>   F451 considers this to be &quot;POV&quot;. I disagree. First of all, it is factually correct. Second of all, it illustrates a relevant aspect of the Borda method. In my opinion, the tactical voting section of this article should be further expanded at some point, but I think that the current version is good considering its brevity. If F451 can come up with a factually correct statement that he feels gives more 'balance' to the section, I will welcome it.

Suppose my sincere preference order is A&gt;B&gt;C. I can best help A defeat B by voting A&gt;C&gt;B instead. But if other voters do the same thing, then C will win, which no one wants.

A majority of participating editors agreed that summability should not be one of these criteria, on the grounds that it is only failed by one method on wikipedia ([[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]]), and that it would be excessive to list it on all other method pages. (In the same way that it would be excessive to list the Pareto criterion on all method pages, when nearly every voting method ([[approval voting]] is the exception that I'm aware of) passes it.)   <LF>   Recently, F451 re-added the summability criterion to this page on the grounds that it is listed on the [[Schulze method]] page. My counter-argument was that the criteria listed on the Schulze method page goes far beyond the standard criteria list, making that page something of an exception to the rule. My reasoning is that if the Schulze method page is used as a justification for adding the summability criterion to this page, then by the same token a whole slew of other criteria should be added as well, such as mutual majority, pareto, local IIA, Woodall's plurality, minimal defense, reversal symmetry, invulnerability to burying, etc. (There are 30 criteria currently listed on the Schulze method page.)   <LF>   So, I think that the summability criterion should not be included in this page unless anyone can offer a better justification.

Manipulation opportunities by strategic nomination are also reduced as there is now truncation information that needs to be collected to predict an outcome and this adds additional uncertainty into a forecast.

This in a general sense does not trivialize the Borda method, as non-majority multi-candidate splits are still dependent on score totals which can bring a candidate with a number of lower rankings higher than one with fewer higher rankings (though given, the difference in number of votes required is much more, now by design.)   <LF>   ::I apologize for my lack of rigor, as I can't seem to find a lower bound calculation, but depending on the details of the election, a sufficiently large difference between Borda scores of two rankings can assure the majority criterion for those two rankings.

Wrong, simple voting can be modified and made a lot better. Written sources attest the existence of voting procedures all through the middle Ages. Confusion in choosing the right system was common, nobody really knew what was best for them.  In 1130, for example, the ambiguity of voting led to the election of two Popes, an event that created a rift within the Catholic Church.   <LF>   In June of [[1770]] a French [[mathematician]] named [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] ([[1733]]-[[1799]]), who was a member of the French Academy of Sciences, proposed a new method of voting. He noted irregularies in the qualifications of members being elected to the Academy. He suggested that voters rank the candidates, and in turn assigning the candidates points on how they prefer them. For example, in a 3-candidate election, the first ranked on a ballot received 2 points, the second obtained 1, and the third ranked got 0 points. The candidate with the most points won.     <LF>   There are many ups and downs of each way of voting, but at the time, The Borda Method was the most appealing. But mathematicians found the answer; they have bad and good news for the voting population. The bad news is Borda's count 2,1,0 is not ideal; it can still lead to distorted results. The good news: within the point method, the Borda count is by far the best. Moreover, our voting rule 1,0,0 is the worst; it gives the least amount of information about what voters want and can yield results that speak against the people's will.    <LF>   This becomes clear from the following examples. In 1970 the centre-right candidate Buckley won the New York senate election even though more than 60% of the votes went for either of the two centre-left candidates. A less obvious but even more disturbing case is the recent Bush-Gore race. If those voting for Nader could have made Gore their second choice (which is a reasonable assumption), the democrats would have won without trouble, as the popular vote suggests.    <LF>   But there are more complicated systems. The run-off method, for example, uses the 1,0,0 point rule in combination with several rounds of vote. Only a more than 50% support makes the winner. Otherwise the last candidate is dropped and the vote is repeated. An alternative is to exclude all but the first two candidates and vote a second time.    <LF>   This system, however, has its flaws too. The first version takes too long to be efficient in a national election, whereas the second can bring weird outcomes. In the 26 November 2000 election for the Romanian Presidency, this method led to a run-off between a left wing extremist and a right wing one. The centre vote had been split among several candidates.    <LF>   The only simple and efficient method that in most cases expresses the will of the majority is the Borda count. Ranking the candidates and assigning a balanced rule of points, as in the 3,2,1 example, would make our elections fairer. We only need to implement this rule. Its time has arrived.    <LF>

Yet Instant Borda Runoff turns out to be a Condorcet method, and Saari at least spends chapters on discrediting Condorcet.

Instant Borda Runoff is a fairly good voting method based on Borda, and if my purpose were to attack Borda, I could do so more easily without pointing out that many of the problems are fixed by IBR.   <LF>   IBR is Not a voting method, it is a tallying method that uses a Borda count ballot.

In the IBR that I know of, the candidate with the fewest points is dropped - along with his points, yes - and then the points for other candidates are recalculated based on ballots that are missing that candidate and where the points go up to n-1 instead of n. Since the distribution of points changes, I don't see why you wouldn't call this a &quot;transfer&quot;, though it is indeed more subtle than IRV's transfer. (And if the distribution of points didn't change, then there would be no point to the runoff.)   <LF>   Not true. In plurality voting, you get one choice.  In irv, you rank candidates, where the rankings are considered seperate ballots.  The initial tally eliminates the candidate with the least number of votes and transfers them proportionally to the remaining candidates.  The instant runoff is an integral part of irv.   <LF>   Borda count can exist completely independent of ibr.  Again, ibr is a tallying method and nothing more than a tallying method.

A valid comparision is &quot;method A satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]] while method B does not.&quot; Of course there is subjectivity in defining criteria, as it is easy to find criteria that one's favorite voting method satisfies and others don't; the best you can do is go with criteria that supporters of different voting methods agree on, and to describe in what voting situations those criteria are useful.   <LF>   We agree again.

Use these criteria ([[:Category: Voting method criteria]]) to show in which areas your voting method does better. Without criteria, you are left with nothing but competing ideologies.   <LF>   I assume that &quot;enumerating paradoxical opportunities&quot; is something you do within Saari's positional models; he certainly likes the word &quot;paradox&quot;. If that's the case, then it is only applicable for comparing positional methods, which is not useful because there are no other ranked positional methods on Wikipedia.   <LF>   If you mean you want to count the number of situations where a voter, given certain information, can get an advantage by voting dishonestly: that doesn't work. You can't just enumerate them, because some situations are more likely than others, and you don't know what information voters will have. Determining the likelihood of strategic voting is a ''really hard'' problem, and it depends entirely on your model of how people vote. Supporters of different voting methods have come up with different models that each support their favorite method, just like Saari's model supports Borda.   <LF>

You are assuming that he is attempting to propagandize Borda count and there is not evidence to prove any such thing.

However, the only machinery he has to do so is his positional model, so the only method he can advocate with the backing of his mathematics is the Borda Count.   <LF>   I will emphasize again that what I take issue with is his criticisms of other methods, including Approval and Condorcet, using a model that does not apply to them. He does this in such a way that the reader is likely to come out convinced that he is absolutely right. I was temporarily convinced after reading the book, at which point my math advisor (who gave me the book, wanting me to look at it critically, and got me interested in studying voting methods) had to talk me back to the real world, making similar arguments to the ones I am making now.   <LF>   Saari criticizes Approval, essentially, by saying that a certain Approval result could correspond to any of a number of different Borda results. If you put this the other way, a certain Borda result could correspond to any of a number of different Approval results. This is not illustrating a flaw in either; it is illustrating that they are thoroughly unrelated methods.   <LF>   He criticizes Condorcet by ''rearranging'' the preferences on Condorcet ballots until he has some imaginary &quot;cyclical ballots&quot;, which do not correspond to the wishes of any voter. He also forces his model on Condorcet and calls the resulting mess &quot;Condorcet noise&quot;. (You could just as well analyze Borda with a Condorcet graph, and call it &quot;positional noise&quot; interfering with the result of Condorcet.)   <LF>   Finally, to show that either he's not really convinced of his criticism of Condorcet, or he didn't think it through fully, he proposes Instant Borda Runoff, which happens to always choose the Condorcet winner when one exists.   <LF>

To me, a &quot;tallying procedure&quot; is like whether you calculate Single Transferrable Vote by writing down numbers on paper, putting rankings into a computer, or moving ballots between bins; that is, they are different mechanical ways to compute the same result. Instant Borda Runoff, however, gives different results than plain Borda, so I would say it is a different election method, not a tallying procedure.   <LF>   Not true.  IBR will likely produce the same winner as a straight Borda tally, unless there are some significant condorcet components in the tally. An election method is all of the procedures used to determine a winner or winners in an election, the tallying procedure being only one part of the overall method.

In fact, most election methods are &quot;likely&quot; to give the same result in the same situation, but they do not always do so, and that is why they are different methods. This is also why IBR is a different method from Borda, just like IRV is different from Plurality, and one Condorcet method is different from another.

Then it is just a misunderstanding. Clones can be any sort of options, and in voting theory you don't care whether the options are people, proposals, or flavors of ice cream.   <LF>   The term &quot;candidate&quot; is often used to mean any kind of option that can be voted for, which is perhaps awkward terminology, but it shouldn't be taken to mean that a statement about &quot;candidates&quot; applies only to people. The terminology doesn't distinguish whether the candidates are people or not, because there's no reason to. The algorithm still works the same way.   <LF>   So &quot;clones&quot; are pretty much the same as what you mean when you say &quot;correlated pairs&quot;. But &quot;correlated pairs&quot; is not standard terminology, and in fact it's not general enough, because they don't just have to come in pairs. You could have a set of 3 or 5 or 100 clone

I remember people saying that a dog coming up to its master and licking its face and wagging its tail when that master comes home is not a sign of happiness.  While certainly, the sensory equipment is different - ie a dog has better sense of smell and better hearing and appears to have better pattern-recognition with respect to that hearing (can tell who it is walking towards the house) - most mammal brains have similar wiring.  This is more especially true in an ape that has so much similarity to humans in a morphological sense.  Is there really some 'mystical' realm of 'mind' that distinguishes the way we communicate and the way an 'animal' communicates?  My opinion is that some, in the name of scientific correctness, bend over backwards so much as to be sliced by Occam's Razor. &lt;grin&gt;   <LF>

During the 1998 on-line chat you saw bits of in Harper's (the whole thing is at www.koko.org/world/talk_aol.html), for example, Koko, without being prompted or questioned, made the sign for nipple, which Francine Patterson, her trainer, interpreted as a rhyme for &quot;people.&quot; (Patterson further claimed that this was a reference to the chat session's audience.) Even if you buy the idea that gorillas, who cannot speak, grasp the concept of rhyme, this sounds like wishful thinking. Similar examples abound: &quot;lips&quot; is supposedly Koko's word for woman, &quot;foot&quot; her word for man. Koko made a lot of signs, and sometimes expressed desires or other thoughts, but nothing in the transcript suggests a sustained conversation, even of the simple sort you might have with a toddler.

There is a single sentence containing criticism that the foundation does very little publishing in scientific journals, but I don't see any mention of this issue. I am not confident enough in my writing abilities to create such a section myself, but this certainly seems like an important point to make.

Animals, regardless of how accustomed they are to humans, will still do things that makes sense to them, not necessarily what we want them to do. Koko has a mind of her own, and if she wants to grab someone's nipple, as a gorilla she's entitled to try. She won't always play by our rules, and if her handlers have not taught (or have been unable to teach) her what's appropriate, then they should simply warn her visitors that this is something she might do and instruct them how to gently reject her probing fingers.''   <LF>

The scientific community is largely against the idea that apes can 'speak' in any reasonable meaning of that term. A baby will cry to let others know it is hungry, but that doesn't mean it's 'telling' people that it is: it's an instinctive or learned response. You can train a dog to bark for food; it's the same thing with these apes, except they make random signs. I have a quote here from Steven Pinker's ''The Language Instinct'' from the only deaf (ie. native sign-language speaker) on the research team (this relates to a chimpanzee supposedly taught to speak):   <LF>   Every time the chimp made a sign, we were supposed to write it down in the log...They were always complaining because my log didn't show enough signs. All the hearing people turned in logs with long lists of signs. They always saw more signs than I did... I watched really carefully. The chimp's hands were moving constantly. Maybe I missed somthing, but I don't think so. I just wasn't seeing any signs. The hearing people were logging every movement the chimp made as a sign. Every time the chimp put his finger in his mouth, they'd say 'Oh, he's making the sign for ''drink'',' and they'd give him some milk...When the chimp scratched itself, they'd record it as the sign for ''scratch''... When [the chimps] want something, they reach. Sometimes [the trainers would] say, 'Oh, amazing, look at that, it's exactly the ASL sign for ''give''!'

Donâ€™t take my word for it. Just read the transcript of the chat session in which Penny â€œtranslatedâ€ between Koko and a bunch of very confused AOLers. Itâ€™s obvious whatâ€™s going on. This woman is reading into gestures Koko keeps making to provoke Penny into giving her a treat!  Native users of American Sign Language who see a &quot;conversation&quot; between Koko and Penny know that this is what is going on.   <LF>   Penny is not a scientist, if you understand &quot;scientist&quot; to mean a person who allows his or her data to be checked by peers. She controls all the research and finances at her foundation with a man named Dr. Ron Cohen, who used to be a scientist in a completely different field, but, since he first trained a camera on Koko and Penny, has come to make a living controlling the film which should be, but is not, shared with as raw data with the scientific community. According to their Gorilla Foundation web site, Dr. Cohen is &quot;an authority figure for the gorillas whose presence is an integral part of their daily routine&quot;, a worryingly odd choice of words which begs explanation more than it clarifies.   <LF>   Penny appears in public, mostly without Koko, to raise money to move her, her gorillas, and The Gorilla Foundation to 70 acres in Maui. Tourists and their dollars are to be encouraged there, but I doubt she'll allow the kind of access that would make it a real scientifically valuable institution.  The purpose, it is clear, is more that Koko have a baby.   <LF>   What seems to be driving Penny crazy is her need to believe she is not delusional or running a scam. Itâ€™s possible Penny really thinks Koko is having a conversation with her, as many, including National Geographic Magazine, have been fooled into thinking. But some part of Penny must have some doubt, because otherwise, why does she hide from her peers? I think some part of her must know and is constantly looking over her shoulder, wondering who will clue in and tell on her. If I'm right, this explains the wild control-freak behavior she's been accused of in court, most of which is garden-variety psycho boss stuff which is not as dramatic as the weird nipple thing.    <LF>   About Koko's nipple fetish, it's obvious Penny either can't or won't stop Koko from grabbing people's nipples, because Penny apparently is not a good enough animal trainer to teach Koko not to do that and instead indulges her like some sad pet owner who doesn't command enough authority toget it across to her dog that humping legs is just not acceptable behavior and will not be tolerated. Animals can't be controlled by delusional, indulgent people who treat them like roommates, pals, or babies. (Watch and learn from the great Cesar Milan of The Dog Whisperer show on the National Geographic Channel!) In the case of a dangerous wild animal who is allowed contact with people, it could be a recipe for disaster. This, in turn, might explain why she hasn't allowed Koko to do any more P.R. Work.  So much for Koko being a spokesman for her species!     <LF>   Francine &quot;Penny&quot; Patterson's scientific malpractice, mistreatment of employees, incompetence as an animal keeper, and spooky detachment from reality should be exposed for the world to see and learn a lesson from.  The Gorilla Foundation should be taken from her and given to responsible parties who can rationally debate and decide what is best for Koko and Ndume.   <LF>

But it's simply not true to equate me with someone who just believes what most people do about Koko, because I have spent lots of time looking at and collecting lots of the evidence.  It's also not true that I wrote most or even much of the article, or that what the article is now reflects what I would have it be.  If you want to see what I would have the article be, look at the Improving the Organization of This Article section below, specifically where I wrote an outline of what I would have the article look like.  You can see there that if the article were the way I envision it, it wouldn't be POV, as you can see, not even the POV of popular belief on the subject.     <LF>   :So yes, my &quot;rant&quot; above is POV, but I think that if you'd seen the evidence, it would be your POV also.  As you are superior to me in not being such a loser or nerd to spend that much time doing that, I guess you must not know as much about this as I do.  I understand that many people see my rant and find it bizzare because they come to this with the popular belief POV, so I'm not surprised by your comments.  But, as I say, don't take it from me, research it yourself with a critical eye.  But, as I say, you're apparently too busy with having a real life and not a loser nerd like me to actually do that, so you won't go research it yourself and see how Occham's razor slices in this case, so you're POV will remain less informed than, and in opposition to, min

I mean, it's your call if you want to rule over the article to get out your personal agenda (or not) but maybe it's worth asking yourself if on this particular subject you're really as objective as an encyclopedia editor needs to be.  As a republican I could get super mad about Barack Obama or something and try to force the page to show lots of controversies, especially if I have lots of time to immediately jump onto and respond to anything I disagree with that pops up, but I recognize that would not be helpful to anyone.  Encyclopedias aren't about personal missions or agendas such as these.  You're obviously a very angry and defensive person, and I'm not interested in working as some kind of online counselor to help you get past that.  I'm just saying maybe it's worth having some self-reflection over so that this article can have some balance rather than attacking someone you consider &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;delusional&quot;, etc. under the guise of editing an encyclopedia.  Really, all I'm saying is what I said before; it's not helpful to anyone to have extremists on any side of an argument dominating an article on wikipedia.  On your talk page you seem to describe yourself as someone with intellectual curiosity, but your actions sound more like the kind of person who fed hemlock to Plato for committing heresy.  Wouldn't it be more rewarding to have a debate on the merits, rather than the kind of personal attack rants you submitted above?  Doesn't the fact that you feel so personally upset by this preclude you from having any kind of rational role to play in editing the article?  Think about it, it's your legacy and body of work that this is a part of, not mine.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

Just look at the AOL chat stuff below, or somewhere else it is on the net where you find it without my edits and comments, maybe better.  Go look at the AOL chat, or the videos on TGF website, whatever you want to Google up.  What explanation can you think of for her impossible statements about what Koko means by her movements?  Does it make sense to you?  I canâ€™t help it: when I see that, the only explanation I can give think I can think of is that sheâ€™s either delusional or running a scam, or some combination of the two.   At this point, I think youâ€™re right, however, a scam would be too much of a conspiracy.  She has to really believe it herself or she couldnâ€™t pull it off.  At this point, it looks to me that the whole thing is a sad delusion, like the old lady with the bread in the park who thinks the squirrels love her.  Iâ€™d love to discuss it with you, but please, first, go see for yourself.  The whole purpose of my â€œrantâ€ was to get people to do that: actually look at the direct evidence with a skeptical eye, and then compare it to common wisdom majority point of view, and, yes, also to my take, and let them judge for themselves.  If they do that, Iâ€™m confident that theyâ€™ll see the facts my way.  It doesnâ€™t take as much time as you seem to think it does.  If you are not interested enough to do that, then how can you be so sure Iâ€™m so wrong about her?  And if Iâ€™m right, what significance does that have on how the article should be written?  Youâ€™ll see, it leaves us in a quandary a bit as to how to approach the article, doesnâ€™t it?  Itâ€™s all very interesting and brings many interesting issues to the fore.   <LF>   :: Second, you have WAY overstated my influence on the article.  I â€œruleâ€ it, â€œdominateâ€œ it?  How so?  I donâ€™t think the authors of the article would agree about their contributions.  Again, compare it to the way Iâ€™d like it to be, in my outline far below.  I think itâ€™d be a fine article that way, donâ€™t you?  Not like my â€œrantâ€ at all, the chips will fall where they may.     <LF>   :: Unlessâ€¦.hey, are you confusing the article with the talk page?  I do say the most on this talk page, so maybe thatâ€™s what you mean about me â€œdominatingâ€.     <LF>   :: Third, why are you even talking about me personally, anyway?  Talk about Koko and Patterson and The Gorilla Foundation and what evidence there is and what it means.    Say why you think Iâ€™m wrong about what.  If you want to talk about me, there might be a place for that.     <LF>   :: Fourth, if your point is that the â€œrantâ€ should be removed, or at least toned down and made more encyclopedic, say so.  It may sound heretical to you, and you may want it censored.  I am willing to hear your case, I was just, again, trying to spur interest and investigation and people thinking for themselves, but I just shouldnâ€˜t say mean things about nice people even if they are true and the personâ€™s delusions are kinda dangerous, if that turns out to be your point after you check it out.  But if thatâ€™s your point, donâ€™t compare me to Socratesâ€™ accusers.  Iâ€™m not the one all upset about someone speaking the truth as he sees it and wanting to shut him u

Koko's handler definitely exhibits all of the signs of someone trying to manipulate the facts.  The mainstream media probably feigns ignorance to it because it makes for a much better story if Koko really is capable of all the things her handlers claim.  I actually looked up information on this subject a few hours ago because I was eager to read a 'feel good' story.  It didn't take long to see that the actual story was in the way Koko's handlers were declaring facts from wholly speculative interpretations.  In many cases, the claims are simply absurd.   <LF>   :::What's most alarming is Francine Patterson's vested interest in all these things being true.  I would ''like'' to believe they were true, but it doesn't affect me one way or the other, but 'Penny' stands to lose everything if the information proves false.  Because she uses the 'truth' of the claims as a mealticket, any 'facts' disseminated by her cannot be considered reliable. I haven't checked the citations on this article, but anything sourced to Penny's research or sites should qualify as [[Wikipedia:SELFPUB#Self-published_and_questionable_sources_as_sources_on_themselves|self-published or original research]].

I think the AOL chat should be enough for anyone, and easily googled by anyone.  It's the closest thing anyone can google of koko using language.  It makes no sense that there would be no proof that she can use langauge anywhere.  My reference is the fact that there is no evidence.  It makes no sence that there would be nothing anywhere on the net by now.  Think about it.  Again, don't take it from me, look for yourself.  How'm I supposed to reference the fact that there is no reference, other than this?   <LF>   So you deleted my additions.  Well, fine, Here is some of the transcript, I guess you couldn't be bothered, so even though it's long here it is, or at least in part.  To read it without my comments and edits, google it yourself.   <LF>   *PENNY: We're going to be on the phone with a lot of people who are going to ask us questions...    <LF>   *KOKO: Nipple. (Koko sometimes uses 'nipple' as a 'sounds like' for 'people.')   <LF>   *PENNY: ...about you and about me. . . Lots of people.    <LF>   *KOKO: That red pink. (Indicating Penny's shirt.)    <LF>   *PENNY: That red pink. Yes, right!    <LF>   *KOKO: Hurry good.    <LF>   *PENNY: This is redâ€”this is pink, exactly.    <LF>   *KOKO: Pink. (Koko reaches for Penny's pocket which contains treats.)    <LF>   Koko has gotton treat for gesturing.  Is there some reasonable doubt?  Study it carefully.  Who is typing for Koko?   <LF>   *PENNY: OK. That's the kind of things they are going to ask.    <LF>   *KOKO: Good.    <LF>   *PENNY: Questions about colors or how you're feeling. OK?    <LF>   *KOKO: That red. (Indicating her own hair.)    <LF>   *PENNY: Honey, this is black.    <LF>   *KOKO: XXX XXX. (XXX looks like 'sun'.)    <LF>   *Koko is trying to sign 'black.' Penny touch prompts 'black'.    <LF>   Koko's typist sees something that looks like the sign for &quot;sun&quot;, but is somehow aware that what she's trying to say is &quot;Black&quot;?  How does they typist know this?  Because that's what penny &quot;touch prompts&quot;?  See what I mean?     <LF>   *KOKO: Black. There hurry. (Indicating Penny's pocket.)    <LF>   *K has one ape doll kiss the other.    <LF>   *KOKO: Kisses.*    <LF>   *KOKO: Lips lipstick.    <LF>   *PENNY: Yes, 'lips lipstick,' right.    <LF>   *KOKO: Lips fake candy give-me. (Then Koko reaches for Penny's pocket.)    <LF>   *PENNY: Wait . . . a minute.    <LF>   *KOKO: Good.    <LF>   *KOKO: Bad hear (left hand on lt. ear) hear.(left hand on rt. ear) Hurry. (Koko reaches for Penny's hand.)    <LF>   Ok, what's your impression as to what is going on here?  Sound like the animal wants a treat and is trying different things to get Penny to give her one?  Can you spell &quot;Okkham's Razor?&quot; (sic, it is spelled &quot;Occam&quot;)   <LF>   *AOL: Is Koko aware that she's chatting with thousands of people now?    <LF>   *PENNY: I just explained it to her so she has some idea.    <LF>   What do you think makes Penny think that is so?  Have you seen any evidence for it?  Where is that when Penny speaks for Koko, she's being accurate?  H   <LF>   *KOKO: Hear. (Koko reaches for Penny's treat pocket.)    <LF>   *PENNY: You want to hear? . . . OK. Koko is ready.    <LF>   *AOL: Welcome, Dr. Patterson and Koko, we're so happy you're here!    <LF>   *PENNY: They said 'Welcome.' . . . That was me actually. I'm translating for her. . . . I gave Koko an explanation of what we're doing and she said 'Good hear.'    <LF>   What would Penny have to do to prove her claims?  Hire a native user of ASL to check the film of her, to varify her claims?  Would that be a good way to test her claims?  Has anyone tried?  What happened?  Stephen Pinker quoted one such person, that's a reference for this article.  What else would constitute a good peer review of her claims?  What happened when they asked for the raw film? Copyrighted property of who?  You'll learn if you go Google around.  Property of The Gorrilla Foundation, not for prying eyes.     <LF>   *Koko pulls Penny close and kisses her cheek.    <LF>   *KOKO: Pink this. (Grasping Penny's shirt sleeve.)    <LF>   *PENNY: She's just signed 'pink' and she's looking . . .    <LF>   *KOKO: Pink this pink. (Indicating Penny's shirt sleeve.)    <LF>   *PENNY: . . . at my shirt. We have had earlier discussions about color today.    <LF>   *Koko pulls Penny's phone hand closer.    <LF>   *PENNY: OK. She wants to listen. Do you have a question?    <LF>   *KOKO: Listen.    <LF>   *PENNY: She said 'listen.'. . .   <LF>   *AOL: MInyKitty asks Koko are you going to have a baby in the future?    <LF>   *PENNY: OK, is that for Koko? Koko are you going to have a baby in the future?    <LF>   *KOKO: Koko-love eat ... sip.    <LF>   *AOL: Me too!    <LF>   *PENNY: What about a baby? You going to have baby? She's just thinking...her hands are together...    <LF>   *KOKO: Unattention.    <LF>   *PENNY: Oh poor sweetheart. She said 'unattention.' She covered her face with her hands..which means it's not happening, basically, or it hasn't happened yet. . . I don't see it.    <LF>   Ok, we can accept Penny's explanation.  By covering her face, Koko has &quot;spoken&quot; this: &quot;I don't see it.&quot;  Or we might think there might have been some other reason that Koko covered her face.  Do YOU think that Penny is justified in &quot;translating&quot; this the way she did?  DON'T take it from me, make your own judgement.  Koko covered her face, and Penny explains what Koko is saying in more detail below.   <LF>   *AOL: That's sad!    <LF>   *PENNY: It is responding to the question. In other words, she hasn't had one yet, and she doesn't see a future here. The way the situation is actually with Koko &amp; Ndume, she has 2 males to 1 female which is the reverse of what she needs. I think that is why she said that, because in our current situation, it isn't possible for her to have a baby. She needs several females and one male to have a family.    <LF>   Credit to Penny for saying &quot;I think that...&quot;  Do YOU think Penny was justified in interpreting it that way?  Is this science?  You think there is enough evidence yet that Penny conflates wildly from Koko's movements that &quot;Oh, Koko means this, &quot;Koko means that&quot;.     <LF>   *AOL: Do you see that situation changing when you get the Gorilla preserve on Maui?    <LF>   *PENNY: Yes, we do.    <LF>   *KOKO: Listen.    <LF>   *PENNY: Koko just signed 'listen' and she wants to hear the phone so I'm going to hold it to her for a second. Did you hear them? (to Koko.)    <LF>   *KOKO: Huff.*    <LF>   *PENNY: She just made a vocalization. Did you hear that? That was her talking on the phone.    <LF>   *AOL: Hi Koko! I can hear her! She breathed at me! This is so cool!    <LF>   *PENNY: I'm working to create a family here in Woodside which would mean that we would need to add an additional female at a minimum. So I've been working with the zoo community to do that. And in Hawaii, we'll have much more space which means we will be in a much better situation to welcome additional gorillas to our family and then she's almost assured to have a family of her own.    <LF>   *KOKO: Purr.*    <LF>   *AOL: So she really is looking forward to this!    <LF>   *PENNY: That's a happy sound when I said 'a family of her own'...Yes, she seems to be responding to my English.    <LF>   In YOUR opinion, does Koko seem to be responding to Penny's English?  What does Penny seem to be doing?   <LF>   *AOL: SBM87: ask What are the names of your kittens? (and dogs?)    <LF>   *KOKO: Candy give-me.    <LF>   *PENNY: OK.    <LF>   *Penny gives treat.    <LF>   *KOKO: See give-me. (Indicating the phone?)    <LF>   *PENNY: What's the name of your kitty ? Kitty's name and dog's name?    <LF>   *K picks up the foot of the large stuffed gorilla doll she is sitting on.    <LF>   *KOKO: Foot... (Many times, first on the doll's foot then on her own foot.)... Foot. (Twice on the doll's foot.)    <LF>   *PENNY: 'Foot' isn't the name of your kitty.    <LF>   *KOKO: Hear lip.    <LF>   Is this the ASL sign for &quot;foot&quot; or just touching a foot?  Touching her lips is &quot;translated&quot; as &quot;lips&quot;, so it's a reasonable question, no?  Just asking, but wouldn't you like to see the film?  Try to find it, or any raw data released by her to the scientific communty without her &quot;interpretation&quot;.  She writes these papers and they say &quot;Koko made this or that ASL gesture today&quot;, but who saw it does she accompany the papers with any film so these things can be independantly verified?  Go ahead, try.  Then you write your article containing truth and facts about what this animal can and cannot do.  I will say something out loud now.  Koko the gorilla does not use sign language.  If she did, there would be some proof, and there isn't any.  Just more of this, &quot;Oh, Koko means this, Koko means that....&quot;  Watch:   <LF>   *PENNY: She wants to hear the lady on the phone. Maybe you can ask her that question.    <LF>   Penny puts the phone to K's ear.    <LF>   *AOL: Koko, what's the name of your cat?    <LF>   *KOKO: Huff* no. (Headshake.)    <LF>   *PENNY: She just gave some vocalizations there... you probably heard soft huffing.    <LF>   *AOL: I heard that soft puffing.    <LF>   *PENNY: Now shaking her head 'no'. Are you not going to answer that question?    <LF>   *K pulls PP's head close &amp; kisses her cheek.    <LF>   *AOL: Question: Do you like to chat with other people?    <LF>   *PENNY: Koko, do you like to talk to people?    <LF>   *KOKO: Fine nipple.    <LF>   *PENNY: Yes, that was her answer. 'Nipple' rhymes with 'people,' OK? She doesn't sign people per se, so she may be trying to do a 'sounds like...' but she indicated it was 'fine.'    <LF>   Think for yourself.  Does that make sense?     <LF>   *K climbs up on lg. box &amp; PP asks her to turn around.    <LF>   *KOKO: Give-me. (For more treats.)    <LF>   *AOL: BSikor439 wants to know, Koko, Which of your paintings do you like most? Is she still painting?    <LF>   *PENNY: Uh-huh. OK. Gosh, you know, she hasn't seen her paintings for awhile. She is (still painting.)    <LF>   *K starts getting down from box and it comes away from the sink.    <LF>   *AOL: Tell us what she's doing right now!    <LF>   *PENNY: She's re-arranging the furniture in her room, basically. Let me move some of these boxes back. There's a lot of stuff here. Let me ask her if she LIKES to paint...one second..She's taking a toilet break.    <LF>   *AOL: Dr. Patterson, why is this such an important project?    <LF>   *PENNY: We're learning so many things on a number of levels, many of which I did not predict. What's that? [jingling sound] What's she got? Wait a second.    <LF>   *AOL: You've devoted your whole life to it! What are we learning?    <LF>   *PENNY: I had started to simply see if another species could communicate with us in our own language, that being sign language. And we have found that, yes, that is so and that she is actually very creative with that language (K returns.) and that we share not only the ability to form words and thoughts but also to talk about abstract things like feelings, the past and future...    <LF>   *AOL: I can see that!    <LF>   Can you &quot;see that&quot;?   <LF>   *PENNY: ...so those were sort of surprises, that she would be so creative. And that she would be essentially adding to the process. What I've discovered in the meantime is that she has already got the system, it's not that I gave her a system to communicate. Gorillas already communicate with a rich vocabulary of gestures. (K looks at a birthday card.) What I've done is simply share the vocabulary with her. So those things were all unexpected. We have a window into the mind of another species, which is, I think, one of the values in (that) this species is really part of our family as humans.They are our closest living relatives. So we stand to learn a huge amount about ourselves - our ancestry. How we might have evolved into the species we are today. That's just part of it. I could go on. We are learning a lot about gorillas themselves in terms of things as diverse as reproductive physiology...    <LF>   *KOKO: This. (Indicating a picture in a magazine she is looking through.)   <LF>   Well, Penny does seem to think her work is very important.  But what does koko do?  Points to a picture.  Well, extends her finger at it for some reason.  Did Koko use the ASL sign for &quot;this&quot; by pointing to a picture?  Did Koko sign the word &quot;this&quot;?    <LF>   *PENNY:... to their ability to direct their own lives, in a sense, with a language tell us what they would like and how they would like to see things happen in the future; react to things in the environment and these are things that are quite unexpected sometimes.    <LF>   *KOKO: This. (Indicating another picture in the magazine.)    <LF>   *PENNY: Things that are not even meant for Koko's ears, she will respond to things at rather a sophisticated level. We have documented her comprehension of English and this is not just at the level of tone (of voice), but this is at the level of the tiny pieces that the language is made of. . .she actually discriminates phonemes. And that kind of thing had never been know before. The fact that they can create representational art is yet another aspect that I certainly didn't expect but that has implications for anthropology in terms of how far back the roots go for this kind of representational behavior.    <LF>   Oh, this is another good one you could try for yourself.  Google yourself up a painting by Koko and see how undisputably &quot;representational&quot; it is, IN YOUR OPINION.   <LF>   *KOKO: Lip apply-lip lipstick. (Looking at the picture of a woman model in the magazine.) This. (On the page)    <LF>   Koko turns the pages then puts magazine down then grooms the fingers of the large stuffed gorilla doll.    <LF>   AOL: I've heard people say she's not really communicating -- I think she's smarter than we are-- after all, how many of us can speak Gorilla!    <LF>   *PENNY: Exactly! She has learned our language but we haven't learned hers. So that does say a lot about the relative capacities of our species to communicate with another one.    <LF>   K takes Penny's hand and Penny sits down close to Koko.    <LF>   *KOKO: Purr.*    <LF>   *AOL: What new is there to learn after 26 years?    <LF>   *PENNY: Every day brings new surprises in terms of learning about gorillas in order to save them, but also in terms of learning about ourselves and mainly that consists of (learning about) new ground about how similar we are. Every little nuance that she comes up with often surprise me, and I don't know why I'm surprised, but I am still surprised when she shows a new level of sophistication. . . She's back.    <LF>   *AOL: A basic earthy question for Koko from Earth2Kim: Koko, what is your favorite food, fruit, or vegetable?    <LF>   *PENNY: OK, hey. We got a question for you, honey. Whats your favorite food? The one you like eat the very best. What's your favorite food? The one you like best.. Ok...she's thinking...    <LF>   *AOL: People have a lot of stereotypes!    <LF>   *KOKO: Sip.    <LF>   *PENNY: She likes drinks. What your favorite drink? Do you have a favorite drink?    <LF>   *KOKO: Drink apple.    <LF>   *AOL: SickboyRE asks: Koko, have you taught other gorillas sign language, on your own?    <LF>   *PENNY: That's a good question. Have you taught other gorillas to sign?    <LF>   *KOKO: Myself lip.    <LF>   *PENNY: She taught herself. That's really true, too. That's very good and I think what part of that answer might be, is that she's taught us. In other words, 'myself lip' was her answer and 'lip' is her word for woman. So 'herself' has taught 'lips', perhaps. So there are a couple of interpretations there.   <LF>   So, assuming your are a reasonable intelligent person, do YOU think Penny is justified in interperating koko's hand movements as evidence that she understood the question and responded like that?   <LF>   *AOL: She's really creative!    <LF>   *PENNY: Uh-huh, and I think she's acknowledging that in that answer.    <LF>   *AOL: She makes up some of her own terms, like 'lips' for woman.    <LF>   *PENNY: Oh yes, and 'foot' for male.    <LF>   Don't you wonder, how exactly does Penny ''know'' that Koko means &quot;male&quot; when she formed the ASL symbol for &quot;foot&quot;, (assuming Koko did)?  Well, we can't know cuz we can't see Koko, but even given the benefit of a doubt, what do you think?  Koko makes a gesture.  Was she trying to say the word &quot;foot&quot;?  What would it take for you to know?   <LF>   *AOL: Another question from the audience: Does Koko like birds? I have the bird t-shirt she painted -- I'm wearing it now!    <LF>   *PENNY: Koko sweetheart, do you like birds? Do you like birds?.. She's very thoughtful today, she walked away, she's looking out the window...    <LF>   *AOL: She's looking at the birds!    <LF>   *PENNY: You know actually there are a number of blue jays that have been frequenting her play yard because they are nesting nearby and she looking out into the play yard. She's going to look at them, right.    <LF>   *AOL: Are there any birds out there now?    <LF>   *PENNY: She's looking out the window and one just flew by. She [expresses herself] with actions and this is very characteristic of young children. Actually, the newer ways of studying very young children is to look at very subtle behaviors. She's looking out the window...    <LF>   *KOKO: Lips.    <LF>   *PENNY:... and signing 'lips', which is her word for 'woman'. I can't see what she's seeing completely. I'm at an angle with the window and can't leave where I am.    <LF>   Before Penny said &quot;nipple&quot; is her word for &quot;woman&quot;.  Now &quot;lips&quot; is her word for &quot;woman&quot;.  Ok, Koko has two words for &quot;woman&quot;.  But how in in the world could could Penny know that Koko means &quot;woman&quot;?      <LF>   *AOL: This is a very abstract one for her: Are you content with your life? That was from Jedi114. I'm very curious to see what she might say to that! We know she might not be able to answer everything, but we're going for it anyway!    <LF>   (Koko comes back)    <LF>   *PENNY: OK. I can ask that in a different way. Can you come here sweetie and be patient? She's got her back to me. Koko, are you happy?    <LF>   *KOKO: Fine.    <LF>   Now that exchange DID seem like communication, didn't it?  Every now and then there might be a word or two in isolation that sound like linguistic interaction.  Like, once in a hundred, an exchage goes something like, &quot;Are you happy?&quot;  &quot;Fine&quot;.  But then two seconds later, it's &quot;Are you happy, Koko&quot;?  &quot;Foot&quot;.     <LF>   *AOL: Here's one: Koko, where would you like to visit?    <LF>   *PENNY: That's hard because Koko doesn't travel.    <LF>   *AOL: We were wondering about that.    <LF>   *PENNY: So, her concept of space is very limited compared to even a child, because we really stay here of necessity. So we could ask her if she would like to go to Hawaii.    <LF>   *AOL: Would she like to go to Hawaii?    <LF>   *PENNY: Would you like to go to Hawaii?    <LF>   *KOKO: Look.    <LF>   *PENNY: She says 'look.'    <LF>   *AOL: Me too!    <LF>   *PENNY: : Maybe she'd like to see it first. She actually has travelogs of Hawaii that she looks at on her video machine; travelogs, Hawaii videos. So she has seen it.    <LF>   Ok, I suppose you could tell me that a reasonable person could read that and find Penny justified in her interpretation of Koko's meaning by signing &quot;look&quot;, assuming that is what Koko did?     <LF>   *AOL: Does she watch TV?    <LF>   *PENNY: Yes, public broadcasting only. Right, so she'd like to look at Hawaii.    <LF>   *KOKO: Think XXX. (XXX - Koko's hand is partially out of frame - possibly 'lie-down.')    <LF>   *PENNY: What do you think about Hawaii? We talk a lot about it.    <LF>   *AOL: Storm 1004 asks: Dear Koko...I've watched you for years now...your gentle spirit is inspiration for many... I'd like to know what you'd like for your birthday.    <LF>   *AOL: What a sweet question!    <LF>   *PENNY: OK. Your birthday is coming up, Koko. What do you want for your birthday? What do you want?    <LF>   *KOKO: Birthday... Food smokes.    <LF>   *AOL: SMOKES?    <LF>   *PENNY: Well, she sort of signed 'food' and 'smokes.' You have to understand...Smoke is also the sign for her kitten. Her kitty's name is Smoky. So that one could have a double meaning.. Yes, she (does) still have Smoky. She's looking out the window right now, so her back is to me.    <LF>   Seen enough?  Google the rest yourself, if you're still not convinced.  It goes ''on and on'' like this.  To MY mind, I can't understand how any reasonable, objective person could read this and interpret it differently than I have, but maybe I'm wrong.  Respond, it's been a long time now, am I wrong?   <LF>   Don't take it from me!  Go see for yourself!  Google the rest of the transcript, look at it scientifically, what does it indicate to you?  Can you imagine any informed, reasonable person interpreting it in any other way than I have?  What everyone thinks about Koko is wrong.  Now, look at the article again.  What needs to be done?   <LF>

I was personally embarrassed some time ago when I cited her as an example of 'talking animals' in an online debate, only to have my opponent thoroughly (and deservedly, I fear) trash my argument by digging up the AOL webcast transcript. As evidence for animal communication skills that thing is an epic fail.   <LF>   :Two other points:   <LF>   :* I signed up at [http://www.koko.org/index.ph Koko's website] using, as I always do, a mailbox I created specifically for the purpose. Within weeks that mailbox began to receive avalanches of seriously low-grade spam from hardon-pills and online pharmacies, pump'n'dump and the like. I complained to the koko.org main address, but have received no reply. I'm confident that my contact list has not been compromised, and while this may mean only that someone at koko.org has a little sideline selling their maillist, it's not a very good sign.   <LF>   :* Other talking apes in what may be more professional surroundings, such as Washoe and Kanzi, have had their abilities analysed by linguists, and compared with that of human infants. One result I recall is that Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) of bonobos tends to stick at three-word sentences: 'green ball give' and so on - even though they will understand much longer sentences spoken ''to'' them. In their early stages of learning, bonobos will keep pace with and even outstrip their human counterparts for a while, but in time human children will start to synthesise sentences with larger and larger MLUs. I've yet to see any such data on Koko's signing. Any serious data at all, in fact.   <LF>   Apologies if the preceding comes across as chat, but this whole thing is very sticky. As long as there are two competing sides to this subject, NPOV may be impossible to decide. I certainly can't. Until there's some definitive data, caution and scepticism seem advisable.

One day   <LF>   when Koko had been, with some effort, lured inside from her yard for   <LF>   some purpose unremembered by me, Penny Patterson noted that a purple   <LF>   plastic toy that she had been playing with was missing. Penny searched   <LF>   the yard without finding the toy. It was important that she find it,   <LF>   since Michael was soon to enter the yard, and he had a habit of trying   <LF>   to eat plastic, which wasn't at all good for him. Penny thought of   <LF>   taking Koko back into the yard and asking her by sign language where   <LF>   the toy was. She decided against this tack because of the anticipated   <LF>   effort required to lure Koko back inside. Following a hunch, Penny   <LF>   drew a diagram of the yard and its furniture, showed it to Koko and   <LF>   asked her where the toy was. Koko promptly pointed to the image of a   <LF>   barrel in the drawing. The toy was found under the barrel. Needless to   <LF>   say, Penny was more than a little surprised. Nothing of this sort had   <LF>   been tried before by her.&quo

The rationale beyond the removal is a sound application of WP policies, but on due consideration I am reverting the removal and leaving the unsourced tags. The claims - that some have said Koko does use language and some claim she hasn't, and that she is claimed to understand a significant number of spoken English words - do need citing, but I think they are central enough to the primary context of the article that a potential reader is better served by leaving them it, and perhaps it will better provoke someone to source them. I would do it myself - and I believe the book by Patterson and Cohn will source two of them and any of the literature critically reviewing the ape ASL experiments the third - but finding the precise reference will need someone who has those sources at hand, which I don't. Again, the principle behind the removal by the anon was sound, but in my opinion the informativeness of the article, however imperfect it may be, as well as the future evolution of the article, is better served by leaving them in, tagged. While there is significant controversy whether Koko does use language, I believe there is no controversy that all of the claims mentioned have been made in notable sources and thus should be include

To place information in an article that is unsourced, with the reason for the absence of a source that you don't have access to the sources, flies in the face of [[WP:V]]. The information can always be added later by someone who does have access to the sources. Instead, you should move the unsourced information to the talk page. If a source is found, no problem. Otherwise, however, it can linger unsourced in the article for months or years (yes, I have seen such unsourced statements remain in articles for more than a year). But with your line of reasoning that &quot;someone can source it later&quot;, I could go on an edit spree and add everything that pops in my head to an article as long as I know I read it somewhere even though I can't get to the source. Sorry, that's not the way it's done on Wikipedia. I'll give this issue a couple of weeks, then I'll be moving the unsourced material to the talk page.

And I hope someone (maybe even one of us) will be somewhere where we have access to sources as soon as possible. In the meanwhile, we're here to write an encyclopedia. If the fact whether someone had really made that claim was controversial, or the inclusion of the claims was advocating one point of view in an unbalanced way, or harming an individual, then we should be merciless in removing them while unsourced. In this case, however, the fact that some experts have claimed that Koko uses language and some have not, and the fact that the claim has been made that Koko understands a large number of spoken English words, is uncontroversial. The actual issue of whether Koko is using language is controversial, but not the fact the claim and counterclaim have been made. Whether one believes those claims have foundation or not, they have been made in a verifiable way. I hope very much that someone is able -- soon I hope -- to look up the references and source them. But while noone has done so yes, the presence of fact tags is more likely to provoke someone to do it than removing them. But it is a judgement call and there is a slippery slope argument issue there, so I would be comfortable, if no one is doing anything, to move to the talk page pending verification.

No legitimate encyclopedia writes an article with the intention of adding the sources later. It just doesn't work that way. As for whether the information you added is balanced, that's a matter of opinion. It does present more than one point of view, but does it present it in a way that reflects the available facts? The answer to that question is unknown based on the article because none of the information is sourced. I don't think we are in complete disagreement on this matter, but I also don't think allowing unsourced material to remain in an article more than a few weeks is acceptable Wikipedia practice.

Please, point out where I'm off-base.    <LF>   ::This is a column from a Maui newspaper which seems to try to investigate questions sent in by readers.  This reader wants to know what's taking so long with the gorilla preserve.  Before answering the question, the reporter reviews the facts.  Way back in 1996, a former ML&amp;P chairman basically gifted a 65 year lease to the G.F. for Penny to continue her work, to improve poor Koko's life, and to save the gorillas.  How it will help save the gorillas is not clearly stated, but it's sort of implied that they will establish a breeding troop there.  In 2000, preliminary work was done: permits, foundations, some back-hoeing for a pond.     <LF>   ::Since then?  The reader's question?  The reported called ML&amp;P.  They didn't comment.  I interpret that to mean that their statements back in 2005 stand.  They no longer want to do it.  They want to help native creatures instead, they've said on record, and don't want to retract or repeat those statements, I suppose because it's too late for them to change their minds, they'd signed it over to them for 65 years.  But the 2005 ML&amp;P earlier statements are not &quot;superceded&quot; by this article.  The 2005 statements stand.  ML&amp;P regrets the agreement and wants out.   <LF>   ::The reporter called the G.F.  They got a spokesperson.  She talked alot about saving gorillas, but what does she say about the reader's question, what ever happened to that preserve that was started so long ago? Answer: They are about halfway through a re-design phase.  They have to finish just as much re-thinking and re-design as they had already done, and then it &quot;should&quot; take &quot;about&quot; a year to construct.  They are doing this not because they don't have the money, but because they want to make sure it'll be all modern and environmentally safe because TGF cares so much about the people of Maui and having a good relationship with ML&amp;P.   <LF>   ::You want to tell me something that you feel I don't understand.  It's a pretty insulting thing to say about Hawaiian people, and hardly established as fact.  But there is something I say that you don't understand about this article.  The encoraging &quot;soon&quot; tone all comes from a paid G.F spokesperson.  What would you expect her to say if the real reason were &quot;We haven't come up with enough money&quot; or &quot;MP&amp;L is putting up resistance&quot;?  She's a paid spinmeister!   <LF>   ::But read her words carefully.  The spokeswoman says the redesign process is about halfway finished.  When did it start?

Right now the article reads like the author secretly thinks they are running a program where making everything up in order to get funds so they can rape gorillas for fun.  I'm sure that reality is somewhere in between &quot;they are evil and making everything up&quot; and &quot;the gorilla can speak just like humans.&quot;  If someone neutral can come in and make sure Chrisrus' points are being included without turning the article into an indictment of Koko and her trainer that would be great.

Maybe we should start there and move all the debate of whether or not (or to what extent) she is speaking language into a controversy section so that the whole article doesn't have to read like an indictment of the entire program and everyone who was ever involved.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”

What ever was trying to be construed in the last 4 or 5 sentences was completely lost in the verbiage.  Anyone's guess is as good as mine?   <LF>   &quot;On April 12, 1998, an event promoted as an on-line chat with Koko took place on AOL. The transcript of this event is available on many locations on the Internet, and contains at least one instance of Koko making a statement which may be construed as an example of Koko's use of language: &quot;Lips fake candy give me.&quot;, uttered while Koko was trying to get Patterson to give her a treat. It is possible that the ape actually meant to say &quot;Something is disagreeable about my oral area. Penny, give me a treat.&quot; Koko also substitutes the sign 'girl' with the sign 'lips' and the sign 'fake' to describe a lie or to express doubt about the truth of a statement. This could mean that Koko felt Penny was tricking her and wouldn't give her the treat. The last three words are particularly striking, as they would constitute the use of an imperative verb accompanied by both a direct and an indirect object. It should be noted, however, that Koko does try many other, seemingly random, words before and after this &quot;utterance,&quot; seemingly in order to achieve the same goal, that Koko does not clearly seem to understand any language being directed to her, and there is no video of Koko making the movements to form this sentence. In any case, &quot;candy give me&quot; may be the closest thing to direct widely available evidence that Koko does use grammar.&quot;   <LF>   This paragraph contradicts itself and really doesn't make sense.  It also doesn't have any sources.  I propose it's deleted from the article.

If that baby grows to 10 and still only uses 1000 words and does not form sentences then noone would claim that they speak English or that they have acquired functional language. Nor would anyone consider that you speak Italian merely by memorizing a dictionary of the language. The fact that ordinary language sometimes doesnt distinguish between vocabulary and language is not really an argument her

(To the degree to which they can do so that is). And while you're of course right that it'd have to be qualified as being of a very basic level, it surely couldn't be said they don't have any language ability ''at all'' in that hypothetical situation. How would the distinction between someone who knows words and uses them appropriately, and someone who has no language ability whatsoever be made, from an academic point of view. I mean what are they using if not languag

Words that come from English&quot; -So English words; words in the English language. How is 'using a word' distinct from 'saying a word' as in speaking. Aren't they then using that language to communicate? If someone says 'chip?' to offer you a chip, did they use language or not? It's an English word, so they're using English, which is a language. Of course language is more than that, but it's still part of language. In the same way that maths is more than adding, but you're still doing maths if you can add but don't know multiplication, division, fractions, etc. I hope this isn't coming across as argumentative, I'm just trying to clarify this point, which I think is relevant for the articl

Using words is using a part of language, but it is not using language just like a collection of bricks is not a house. Using an English word correctly is not the same as knowing English. Using 1000 ASL signs is not the same as knowing ASL. Your math analogy is incorrect because addition is a process, not an item. The correct analogy would be that knowing the numbers 7, 9, 36, 98 and 2205, is not the same as knowing how to count. It is quite simple really, but it requires that you are willing to understand that language in fact is something other than what you apparently believe it is, namely it is a system of processes and mutual relations between lexical items, not the mere collection of words. That being said it is of course the case that the question of whether Koko uses language or not depends on how we define language. But the definition under which Koko can be said to use language (i.e. knowing a collection of words), just happens not to be accepted as a valid definition by any specialists in languag

I'd say the analogy would be closer to if someone could recognise amounts, like 1, 2, and 3. And use those numbers correctly, but not count higher than small numbers.

So if you're using words, then it follows that you're using language. That part of language at least. So it can't be correct to call it 'non-linguistic communication'. You're not using the parts of language that involve syntax or grammar. -Which your edit to the article correctly points out/clarifies I might ad

True linguistic communication is defined by having syntax, recursivity, displacement, productivity, and words (form/meaning pairings). It is not language unless it has all of those things.

Words are part of language; therefore using words is using language follows perfectly logically. It isn't making a claim that you are using any more than that part of language.
