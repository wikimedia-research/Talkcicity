== Welcome! ==
Hello, 3mlimestone, and '''[[Project:Introduction|welcome to Wikipedia]]'''!&amp;#32;Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/3mlimestone|your contributions]].

I noticed that one of the first articles you edited was [[:User:3mlimestone/sandbox/3m Limestone Corporation]], which appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]]. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral]] and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article.&amp;#32;Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason.

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or another editor to proofread it. See [[Help:Userspace draft|our help page on userspace drafts]] for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators willing to provide copies of deleted articles|anyone from this list]] and they will [[Wikipedia:Userfication|copy it to your user page]].

One rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Sharing accounts|be blocked from editing]]. Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Promotional names|usernames which imply that the account belongs to a company or corporation]]. If you have a username like this, you should [[Wikipedia:Changing username|request a change of username]] or create a new account. (A name that identifies the user as an individual within a given organization may be OK.)

Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign]] your messages on [[Help:Using talk pages|talk page]]s using four [[tilde]]s (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically insert your username and the date.  If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:Timtrent|my talk page]], or ask your question on this page and then place '''{{Tlc|Help me}}''' before the question.

[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|alt=|link=]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;A tag has been placed on your sandbox, [[:User:3mlimestone/sandbox/3m Limestone Corporation]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11]] of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the page appears to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service, and which is a violation of our policies regarding acceptable use of user pages. Although you may start a draft about your company, user pages are intended for active '''editors''' of Wikipedia to communicate with one another as part of the process of creating encyclopedic content, and should not be mistaken for [[WP:NOT#WEBHOST|free webhosting resources]]. Please read [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]], [[Wikipedia:User page|the guidelines on user pages]], and, especially, our [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business|FAQ for Organizations]]. 

If you can indicate why the page is not blatant advertising, contest the deletion by clicking on the button that looks like this: [[File:Speedy delete contest button.png|250px|link=&lt;!-- leave this blank --&gt;]] which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[{{TALKPAGENAME:User:3mlimestone/sandbox/3m Limestone Corporation}}|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would help make it encyclopedic. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn-user-sandbox --&gt;  [[User:Drm310|Drm310]] ([[User talk:Drm310|talk]]) 06:41, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

== Your username ==
[[Image:Ambox warning blue.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] '''Welcome to Wikipedia.''' I saw that you edited or created [[User:3mlimestone/sandbox/3m Limestone Corporation]], and I noticed that your username, &quot;3mlimestone&quot;, may not comply with our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]]. Please note that you '''may not use a username that represents the name of a company, group, organization, product, or website'''. Examples of usernames that are not allowed include &quot;XYZ Company&quot;, &quot;MyWidgetsUSA.com&quot;, and &quot;Trammel Museum of Art&quot;. However, you are invited to use a username that ''contains'' such a name if it identifies you personally, such as &quot;Mark at WidgetsUSA&quot;, &quot;Jack Smith at the XY Foundation&quot;, and &quot;WidgetFan87&quot;. 

Please also note that Wikipedia does not allow accounts to be [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Sharing accounts|shared by multiple people]], and that you [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion|may not advocate for or promote]] any company, group, organization, product, or website, regardless of your username. Moreover, I recommend that you read our [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest guideline]]. If you are a single individual and are willing to contribute to Wikipedia in an unbiased manner, please [[Special:Userlogin/signup|create a new account]] or request a [[Wikipedia:Changing username/Simple|username change]] that complies with our username policy. If you believe that your username does not violate our policy, please leave a note here explaining why. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-coi-username --&gt; [[User:Timtrent|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800&quot;&gt;Fiddle&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Timtrent|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#070&quot;&gt;Faddle&lt;/span&gt;]] 07:41, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|35px|alt=]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 105%;&quot;&gt;Your account has been '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] indefinitely''' from editing Wikipedia because it appears to be mainly intended for publicity and/or promotional purposes. If you intend to edit constructively in other topic areas, you ''may'' be granted the right to continue under a change of username. Please read the following carefully.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; margin-top:15px&quot;&gt;
;Why can't I edit Wikipedia?
[[Special:MyContributions|Your account's edits]] and/or [[Special:MyPage|username]] indicate that it is being used on behalf of a company, group, website or organization for purposes of promotion and/or publicity. The edits may have violated one or more of our rules on spamming, which include: [[Wikipedia:Spam#External link spamming|adding inappropriate external links]], [[WP:Spam|posting advertisements]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion|using Wikipedia for promotion]]. Wikipedia has many articles on [[:Category:Companies|companies]], groups, and [[:Category:Organizations|organizations]], but such groups are generally discouraged from using Wikipedia to write about themselves. ''In addition'', usernames like yours are disallowed under our [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Promotional names|username policy]].
&lt;/div&gt;

;Am I allowed to make these edits if I change my username?
Probably not, although if you can demonstrate a pattern of future editing in strict accordance with our [[Wikipedia:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy, you ''may'' be granted this right.  See [[WP:FAQ/Organizations|Wikipedia's FAQ for Organizations]] for a helpful list of frequently asked questions by people in your position. Also, review the [[WP:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest guidance]] to see the kinds of limitations you would have to obey if you did want to continue editing about your company, group, organization, or clients. If this does not fit in with your goals, then you will not be allowed to edit Wikipedia again.

;What can I do now?

If you have no interest in writing about some other topic than your organization, group, company, or product, you may consider using [[WP:Alternative outlets|one of the many websites]] that allow this instead. 
 
If you ''do'' intend to make useful contributions here about some other topic, you must convince a [[Wikipedia:Administrators|Wikipedia administrator]] that you mean it. To that end, please do the following:

*Add the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include &quot;tlx or the first | character&quot;. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-spamun|Your proposed new username|Your reason here}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your proposed new username&quot; with a new username you are willing to use. See [[Special:Listusers]] to search for available usernames. Your new username will need to meet our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your reason here&quot; with your reason to be unblocked. In this reason, you must:
**Convince us that you understand the reason for your block and that you will not repeat the edits for which you were blocked.
**Describe in general terms the contributions that you intend to make if you are unblocked.

If you believe this block was made in error, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|Your reason here}} below, but you should read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks|guide to appealing blocks]] first. &lt;/div&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names|{{PAGENAME}}]]{{z17}}&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spamublock --&gt;—[[User:Orangemike|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#F80&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/span&gt;]] &amp;#124; [[User talk:Orangemike|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FA0&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] 22:41, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

== Wikipedia and copyright ==
[[File:Control copyright icon.svg|30px|link=|alt=Control copyright icon]] Hello 3mlimestone, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to [[:User:3mlimestone/sandbox/3m Limestone Corporation]] has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|permission]] from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

*You can only copy/translate a ''small'' amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double [[quotation mark]]s (&quot;) and a cited source. You can read about this at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]] in the sections on &quot;text&quot;. See also [[Help:Referencing for beginners]], for how to cite sources here.
*Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information ''in your own words and structure'', in proper [[paraphrase]]. Following the source's words too closely can create [[derivative work|copyright problems]], so it is not permitted here; see [[Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing]]. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/619/01/ hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue].) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] information and to demonstrate that the content is not [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]. 
*Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]. You may also want to review [[Wikipedia:Copy-paste]]. 
*If ''you'' own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you ''may'' be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]].
*In ''very rare cases'' (that is, for sources that are [[public domain]] or [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Copyright#Can I add something to Wikipedia that I got from somewhere else?|compatibly licensed]]), it ''may'' be possible to include greater portions of a source text. ''However'', please seek help at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]] before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources ''may not'' be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you ''do'' confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see [[Wikipedia:Plagiarism]] for the steps you need to follow.
*Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia]].

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk page.  Thank you. &lt;!--Template:uw-copyright-new--&gt; [[User:Timtrent|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800&quot;&gt;Fiddle&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Timtrent|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#070&quot;&gt;Faddle&lt;/span&gt;]] 07:42, 28 March 2015 (UTC)
