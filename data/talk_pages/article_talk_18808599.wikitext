== Requesting books for &quot;further reading&quot; ==

Does anyone have any books that would work well for the &quot;further reading&quot; section? Books that deal exclusively with parapsychology and are academic or through in their explanation of it. Pro, Neutral or anti parapsychology.

====Martinphi's suggestions====
This following isn't accurate, as, for instance, PK if it exists isn't &quot;psychological,&quot; nor can we make the assumption a lot of other things are either.

Change this:

&quot;Parapsychology is the study of evidence for paranormal psychological phenomena&quot; 

To this:

&quot;Parapsychology is the study of evidence for some types of paranormal phenomena&quot;

----

Change this:

Proponents style parapsychology as a discipline compatible with science including schools of psychology, however those assertions and the results of parapsychological work have met with frequent opposition from critics. Historically, the field has attracted notable personalities in psychology including American psychologist and philosopher William James, among others.

Many scientists feel that parapsychological study is at best a fringe science because it involves research that doesn't fit within standard theoretical models accepted by mainstream science. A large portion of parapsychological work involves examining the statistical evidence for 'psi', a generic term described by parapsychologists as indicating anomalies that may be attributed to paranormal phenomena. However, an article published in the February 2007 issue of Nature characterized the &quot;decision whether to pursue a tiny apparent effect or put it down to statistical flaws [as] a subjective one&quot;.[1] The controversy over parapsychological study is an example of the larger debate over the demarcation problem in science, which examines the boundaries commonly drawn between science and non-science. To date there have been no experimental results that have gained wide acceptance in the scientific community as valid evidence of paranormal phenomena.

I'll try and read through the draft today July 2.  I do pick up on things which are subtle POV, such as &quot;Proponents style parapsychology&quot; instead of &quot;Parapsychologists say.&quot;  I don't think that the article needs subtle skeptical or pro POV such as that (inserted by Nealparr who no doubt didn't intend it) to be stable.

One type of bias is repetition, which Nealparr mentions below- we only need to state each position once.

All my suggested changes together:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMartinphi%2FPdraft&amp;diff=142324967&amp;oldid=142121099]

:Everything looks pretty good to me, except for a few things. 
:1. The definition of Haunting is way off in terms of NPOV, it once again takes a qualified statement and turns it in to a blanket statement of fact, thus giving subtle credence to paranormal explanations of &quot;hauntings&quot;.
:2. The standard definition of clairvoyance is more like the paranormal ''reception'' of information. From Webster's: {{cquote|1 : the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses
2 : ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception|}}
:While telepathy is the ''transmission'' of information: {{cquote|communication from one mind to another by extrasensory means|}}
:Other than that, it mostly looks like grammar cleanup and some pretty good clarifications of definition. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#50C878&quot;&gt;[[User:VanTucky|VanTucky]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:VanTucky|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:02, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::The definition changes were mainly trying to make them consistent with other Wikipedia articles- one of which has undergone significant POV changes without sourcing recently, so I went back a bit.  If I recall right, there was one definition which was way off, but the others weren't too bad. The ones you quote aren't bad. '''[[User:Martinphi|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6c4408;&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;sup&gt;phi&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Martinphi|Talk]] Ψ [[Special:Contributions/Martinphi|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 22:39, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::But really the whole thing should be presented from the perspective of parapsychologists.  Then we wouldn't have to worry about mainstream sources or NPOV- we can just use the PA's definitions.  So how about this (and we could change the definitions later):

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Martinphi/Pdraft#Scope]  What do you think? '''[[User:Martinphi|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6c4408;&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;sup&gt;phi&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Martinphi|Talk]] Ψ [[Special:Contributions/Martinphi|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 22:49, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:Mostly good, but again, I strongly object to the definition of Haunting. It is not NPOV. It needs to say that the regular occurences are ''perceived'' as being of paranormal explanation, not that they are of paranormal origin. Simply saying that they positively are of paranormal origin is a violation of a neutral point of view on the topic. And about the generalization that the article should be presented from the perspective of parapsychologists...in a word, no. This is an independent, neutral encyclopedia, and it is our duty to present information about a subject from a neutral perspective. Writing an article from the perspective of its subject is the most fundamental violation of [[NPOV]]. What are you not understanding about the the definition of the phrase &quot;neutral point of view&quot;. Because that's exactly, literally, what it means. Written from a point of view, aka a perspective, that is neutral. We don't just take any organization or individual's self-referential definitions of a subject as truth. We use reliable, independent sources. Using the PA definition is not independent, and is only given in instances when it is helpful to present what parapsychologists think on a subject. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#50C878&quot;&gt;[[User:VanTucky|VanTucky]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:VanTucky|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:59, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::That's not what I said.  I only said, make the ''definitions'' from the PA perspective.  Use the PA glossary for the definitions of what parapsychologists study.  Say that's what we are doing. We would have to change many of the definitions, I'm sure.

::The definitions are always a point of dispute in this article. That's why I just did a quote in my earlier draft. There was some question of whether it was fair use, so then I just went with a comma separated list sans definition. Here's the real problem, even setting the skeptical view to the side, you're trying to define something without explanation. In other words, there can be dozens of feelings about what they are. Simple example, poltergeist. Long thought to be spirits, now thought to be psychokinetic activity coming from a family member. My method was to source it to an authority who actually believes in it. Solution by attribution : ) The scope section isn't actually that important to the article besides showing what they do and do not study. Doesn't actually need the definitions, these are (mostly) common terms and are linked to their pages. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 23:30, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::So you're saying we should only use the definition used by those who believe in paranormal phenomena? That's an absurd violation of NPOV, not mention reliable, third party source verification. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#50C878&quot;&gt;[[User:VanTucky|VanTucky]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:VanTucky|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:38, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::::I'm not saying we should do anything at all. I'm fine with Wikidudeman's version, or the dictionary definition, or some other encyclopedia's definition, or anything where people call it a day and move on. But it's not really that absurd if you think about it, using a believer's definition and attributing it to them so others can agree or disagree. The reason it's not that absurd is because the other groups definition for all of them is &quot;Something that doesn't exist&quot;. That's a really short definition, and you might as well leave the scope off. Besides, that view is already completely covered in the criticism section. Considering it is a scope, and that it is the scope of parapsychologists, and that what we are talking about is what they feel they are doing, it's not inappropriate to use the PA definitions and attribute it to them. It is a primary source section after all. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:11, 4 July 2007 (UTC)

*First line &quot;Parapsychology is...&quot; has historically been a point of edit wars, so whichever version settled on would need a source. Might want to start with LL's suggestion above (Webster) and go from there.

When I read that I think, oh 32% out of 100%, what's the big deal? The controversy centers around the belief that statistically it should be right around 25%, and that 32% is statistically significant. It still reads as the interpretation of the researchers even when the 25% chance expectation is included, just adds context. And with that I'll call it a night. But I didn't see anything that I'd complain about from the beginning to there. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 05:42, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

[I've read through to the criticism section so far. I haven't read that part yet, but since the portion above it is based on the previous version, I thought I'd go ahead and comment on that part of it. There's a few changes that I personally wouldn't have made as they weren't necessary. I feel they have subtle effects on the neutrality but if it means a stable article, I really don't care. They seem to be more a matter of wording preference and there's no substantial shift in meaning. I won't even bother pointing out any of them because it would basically be nitpicking. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 09:33, 2 July 2007 (UTC)]

[Don't need to read through the criticism section thoroughly as it's obviously just a merger. I personally feel that the intro to the section can be summarized (like how many different ways can you say critics believe the experiments are flawed?), but it is a merger of the Controversy article and that's what the Controversy article said, so there it is. All my comments would be stylistic and the issue was neutrality, so I don't have any complaints. I'll continue to point out where things need to be sourced or if there's something that doesn't make sense, but I don't have any actual objections to this draft if it leads to stability. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 09:53, 2 July 2007 (UTC)]

*I would move the second paragraphy under &quot;Selection bias&quot; to the top of &quot;Criticism of misuse of meta-analysis&quot;. That text is a critique of using statistics as evidence for the paranormal, so it would be a misuse of statistics. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:04, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

=====Draft intro concerns=====
*I felt this might get lost, so I'm reposting it here. &quot;Pseudoscience&quot; is not necessary in the intro section where it summarizes the criticisms because it's not a real criticism (more like a conclusion based on criticisms) and because we can be more diplomatic (for stability and neutrality). We can summarize the criticisms without using that word. This is what I posted in response to VanTucky who said that a summarization of the criticism section is that it is a pseudoscience:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The summary of the criticism section is that critics feel that it is a failed, deprecated, or flawed endeavor because it lacks a framework that would make it sucessful, or a methodology that is convincing. This is a stark contrast from an outright pseudoscience that makes no effort whatsoever to be scientific but claims it is based on science, like astrology. That's all rhetoric, though. For the purposes of Wikipedia, pseudoscience is a pejorative and specific guidelines were written up because of this [Pseudoscience] ArbCom. It's a criticism, but not a particularly notable one considering some apply the term to all of psychology or anything that's not a part of the natural sciences. It sort of loses meaning. The point is that it's not necessary for the intro and that we can be more diplomatic.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

I would support a phrasing in the intro that read something like &quot;Critics feel that it is a failed, deprecated, or flawed endeavor because it lacks a framework that would make it sucessful, or a methodology that is convincing,&quot; but I can't in good conscience support the contentious word pseudoscience. I think it's fine for the criticism section, but not for the intro. My phrasing above is nice, short, and to the point and has many sources that can be used for it.

In the [[WP:NPOV/FAQ#Pseudoscience]] guidelines, [[psychoanalysis]] is listed as an example of a theory &quot;which some critics allege to be pseudoscience&quot;. The entire intro to the [[psychoanalysis]] article consists of the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Psychoanalysis is a family of psychological theories and methods based on the work of Sigmund Freud. As a technique of psychotherapy, psychoanalysis seeks to discover connections among the unconscious components of patients' mental processes. The analyst's goal is to help liberate the patient from unexamined or unconscious barriers of transference and resistance, that is, past patterns of relating that are no longer serviceable or that inhibit freedom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That's the entire intro and it doesn't sum up the criticism at all. It does say pseudoscience in the criticism section, but not in the leader. In effect, we would be choosing to put that word in the leader, an unnecessary choice, and I can't personally support that. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 07:14, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

And finally (before I open it up to discussion), it's pretty sad that [[astrology]], which is criticized daily by virtually everyone, has a more neutral intro. I just (more or less) like the live intro better. It's almost cliche now to use the word diplomatic, but that's pretty much what I'm shooting for. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 07:35, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:That is because the lead sentence clearly calls astrology a group of &quot;''systems, traditions, and beliefs''&quot;. There is no claim that it is or may even be a science. You will note that further down in the article, we see the statement &quot;''Although astrology has had no accepted scientific standing for some time, it has been the subject of much research among astrologers since the beginning of the twentieth century.''&quot; Anyway, I agree - it's a well-written article. However, were we to follow its lead, people would howl that we were being biased against parapsychology. &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Antelan|Ante]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User:Antelan|lan]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Antelan|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:13, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

::I agree that this one needs more discussion of the scientific status. That's why the live intro was worded the way it was. There comes a point where there's too much criticism and it changes the tone of the article to being against the topic. The draft version covers it ad naseum. Just in the intro here's a list:

::*Proponents style it as, blah blah, but that's frequently disputed.
::*It's at best a fringe science.
::*Critics say point 1, point 2, point 3
::*The demarcation part now reads as there's a line drawn between science and non-science and parapsychology crossed it.
::*No results are accepted by mainstream science.

::Compared to...

::*The parapsychologists themselves say it's science
::*Some dead guy thought it was interesting

::Now, there's no way this intro is a neutral treatment of the topic. Even [[creation science]] doesn't get the criticism at ever turn treatment. We can do better, and it's my feeling that the live intro (or some variation that's mostly based on it) is not that bad. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 13:33, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Creation science begins, &quot;''Creation science is the creationist's attempt to find scientific evidence that would justify a literal interpretation of the Biblical account of creation.''&quot; A parallel would be, &quot;''Parapsychology is the parapsychologists' attempt to find scientific evidence that would justify a paranormal explanation of commonplace but unresolved occurences and statistical fluctuations.''&quot; I'm not sure that's better, but maybe. The thing is, when you dismiss a topic's validity so smoothly in the intro, you have no reason to keep criticizing it throughout the article. If we were to just call parapsychology pseudoscience right from the get-go, you could pretty much do away with all remaining criticism, so long as you didn't try to portray it as scientific later. That's what they did in astrology and creation science, and it's why there's so much less discussion of controversy here. I'm not sure that those are the models that we want to use for this article. &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Antelan|Ante]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User:Antelan|lan]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Antelan|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:52, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

::::I agree that they aren't good models. I'm using them as examples of how not to go wild on an article. Ours is not a neutral intro. The point of view that parapsychology is not scientific is a contentious point of view and there's plenty of sources that show there are differing mainstream opinions on the matter. We're slanting the intro towards just one in its current incarnation. This is odd because none of the other mainstream encyclopedias do that. While Wikipedia is certainly different, it shouldn't diverge too much from the other encyclopedias in tone, especially since the stated goal of Wikipedia is neutrality. One other thing that's odd is that our intro is less neutral than the entry on parapsychology in the Skeptic's Dictionary [http://www.skepdic.com/parapsy.html]. It doesn't even say pseudoscience. We really need to reword the intro, and if my wording isn't good enough someone needs to offer up some examples that are better, neutral, and with the goal of stability in mind. One thing to consider in doing so is what are we trying to accomplish, an intro or a summary of the article. If it's the former, we don't need to summarize everything (see [[psychoanalysis]], also accused of being a pseudoscience). If it's the latter, why does it mostly just sum up the criticism? Where's the summary of the history, or the summary of the research, or the summary of the current laboratories, and so on? If it's just notable ideas, the most notable is the controversy over using scientific methods to research something that may be outside the scope of science. That's multisourced and can even be sourced to the Skeptic Dictionary. We have a lot of options available to us. Like I said, it's a choice to use the current wording and that's not a choice I would support and one I believe is actually against the spirit of Wikipedia's guidelines. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

The live intro is garbled, and intro should be very basic, beginning with stating the obvious. How about a simple removal of the first two sentences of the second paragraph (so it only makes mention of the meta-analysis about how the debate is part of the larger demarcation of science)? The simple sentence in the first paragraph that says: &quot;Proponents style parapsychology as a discipline compatible with science including schools of psychology, however those assertions and the results of parapsychological work have met with frequent opposition from critics.&quot; is enough of a mention of the two opposing sides of the debate in my view, and as it gives space to both sides equally, I think it's NPOV. Without the first couple sentences, it doesn't summarize the details of the criticism section.

Well, that word is minor, really, though I'd much rather have &quot;say,&quot; with an attribution- a source I can provide easily.  I think you are suggesting a lead more along the lines of that used in [[psychoanalysis]].  Of course, it has to mention the skepticism, but not a full paragraph.

1. What the word means

2. What the field covers

3. What parapsychologists say

4. What critics say.

All that can be covered in just a very few short sentences- one or two more than [[psychoanalysis]].

:Well, I think the full intro in WDM's version is informative and comprehensive as well as balanced, but I don't think a whole paragraph on the debate is necessary per se. As I said above, ehat I'm suggesting is that we cut the second paragraph to only include the stuff about how the debate brings up a further question about the demarcation of science. And then the first paragraph sentence (which will have a bit of tweaking for word choice per above) that says: &quot;Proponents style parapsychology as a discipline compatible with science including schools of psychology, however those assertions and the results of parapsychological work have met with frequent opposition from critics.&quot; seems to be enough of a summarization of the basic contrasting viewpoints of critics and parapsychologists. Previously in the paragraph there is already the definition of the field by the PA, which I think is a good sourced way of showing what parapsychologists think there work is.

====VanTucky's suggestions====
Seems fair to me, but I would not change the definition to Martinphi's version ever. First off, you left out the last part detailing examples. Second, his revision makes it imprecise. No need to point out in the definition that only some types of paranormal phenomena are under the field's purview, as this is detailed later on. Keeping the definition extremely basic is important, for the first sentence anyway. First you establish that is the attempt to find evidence for paranormal activity, then expand in the next sentences to define what activities in particular. Besides, saying that the concrete definition includes and has only ever included these certain types of paranormal phenomena is false. The types of paranormal activity that parapsychology has studied has changed over time, and will empirically continue to do so. [[User:VanTucky|VanTucky]] 19:55, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:::I like the current definition (in your sandbox version).

I've seen many ''claims'' that &quot;many scientists&quot; think that, but no data to support the claim.  Technically, it is perhaps a straw man or needs total attribution, but I think we can get away with it because it is intuitively true. There is no need for it in the introduction, though, because nearly all the sources (such as [http://www.sfu.ca/~beyerste/research/articles/02SciencevsPseudoscience.pdf this]) say the view that parapsychology is pseudoscience is not realistic.

The commentary &quot;...those who hold naive views about parapsychology...&quot; absolutely needs to be removed. It is clearly a violation of NPOV, as it simply states that critics views are naive, not that ''proponents think'' that the views are naive. Again, I guess this goes along with removing the counterpoint from within the section reserved for Criticisms. Also, the part about parapsychologists concern about those who hold a &quot;naive belief&quot; in parapsychology, while being on the opposite side of the spectrum, also both violates NPOV and is slightly off-topic. The section is for outlining criticisms, not parapsychologist's concerns about the study of the field.

====Annalisa's Suggestions====

This evening, I have focused mostly on the criticism section because this is the part that has seen the most changes.  I have made substantial edits to Wikidudeman's draft, and respecting his request not to edit his draft directly, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Annalisa_Ventola/Recommended_edits I have made my edits here] (which, BTW you are welcome to tinker with).  Overall, I have to agree with WDM's general choice of topics for the criticism section, but I thought it could be improved for stability and readability. The following will (I hope) characterize my edits:

1.  I removed all direct quotes.  Not because they were bad quotes, but because I'm afraid that the practice of quoting criticisms will only inspire other editors to quote responses, and I'd hate to see the criticism section turn into the unstable mess that it was before.  Additionally, I don't think that direct quotes are appropriate for a summary style entry.

2.  I removed all content related to 'proponents' for parapsychology.  Again, this is to prevent this section from turning into a criticism/response format.  I think the exposition of the preceeding paragraphs is enough.  Parapsychology states its case.  The critics state theirs. End of story.  As much as I appreciate WDM making room for responses to criticisms, I think we'll have a more stable article without them.

3.  I thought that there was some redundant material, as well as material under some headings that would be more properly placed under different headings.  For example, selection bias and meta-analysis are related concepts.  Statistical deviation is a common criticism of experimental results, etc...  

4.  Vocabulary.  I've tried to lend my expertise here to make the language more precise, and in some cases was able to replace entire phrases with just one or two words.  If you think this has changed the meaning of what you are trying to convey, doesn't match the sources (even though I've read most of them), or if it is too much for a lay person, feel free to put it back.

5. Weasal words.  Sometimes you can't get away from these, but there are too many and I tried to get rid of a few.  For example, in the first paragraph I think that even parapsychologists will agree that the field &quot;does not have a clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information.&quot;

Anyhow, Wikidudeman, I appreciate your efforts.  Do what you will with my draft of the crticism section, but I hope that you will find it helpful and will incorporate at least some of the changes.   --[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 05:13, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

Also, I think that the section on Laboratories, Organizations, and Publications should eventually go back.  I'm not going to push the issue right now because that section was incomplete when the draft was transfered here, but I do think that such information is relevant to an article overviewing the field and should eventually be put back in a more complete form if other editors support it.  --[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 05:35, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::While I agree that we need to prevent it from turning into a &quot;criticism&quot; and then &quot;response&quot; and then &quot;more criticism&quot; again, we also need to refrain from stating supposed facts and then citing their sources. For instance we don't want to say &quot;Parapsychology does not have a clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information.&quot; as if it were an absolute fact, rather say that &quot;it is said that...&quot; and then cite the source. Before I make any changes based on your draft I want to first get at least some input from the other editors on it. So I won't make any changes until then. For instance, What do you all think of removing any response to the criticism in the criticism section? Should it just be an explanation of Parapsychology and then the criticism and no responses to the criticism? So as to avoid constant criticism/response, criticism/response ad infinitum?

:::I won't argue with putting the lead back into the quote above.  I just know from my own experience and from conversations with others in the field that there is little argument about that statement...still, I agree that there might be a problem with stating it as a fact at Wikipedia, so do what you feel is appropriate.

:::As for removing responses, I realize that you are looking from input from other editors, but I really do think that it's the best way to go.  As long as parapsychology is able to state its case by having the status of the field and its major experiments adequately and fairly summarized (after a cautious lead, of course), there's no reason why the critics shouldn't get the floor to themselves for a few paragraphs.  Admittedly, it's difficult to let some of those criticisms go because I can imagine several counter-arguments to some of the points in that section, but really does follow the rules of debate (in this case, each side gets one turn) and we have to consider what is appropriate for a summary.  --[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 06:16, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::What I'm going to do is try to get a consensus on each of the changes you have made. So right now let's start with this: What do you all think of removing any response to the criticism in the criticism section? Should it just be an explanation of Parapsychology and then the criticism and no responses to the criticism? So as to avoid constant criticism/response, criticism/response ad infinitum?

:::^I like that better. That was the idea behind the original rewrite. Research, criticism, references. No flat fact statements and attribute opinions. No back and forth. It seems to be the article structure of most controversial topics at Wikipedia. But if you do it, you'll have to find some way of moving the last part of &quot;Remote Viewing&quot; (Utts/Hyman) to the criticism section. That shouldn't be too difficult, though, because that criticism is against PEAR in general and isn't solely against remote viewing. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 08:09, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::I don't want to speak for anyone else, but there seems to be a consensus going to remove the parapsychology responses from the criticism section as well.

:::That may be a good idea, mixing criticism and response in the same section is pretty much discouraged across the board by [[NPOV]].

::::Agree with VanTucky: in that there is no need for response in the criticism section.  There might or might not be a need for a response section- but I doubt it, and that could come later, and I think only if the criticism response were to get expanded beyond what Annalisa suggests.  My main concern with Annalisa's draft is just that it makes it feel like ''experimenter'' fraud might be a major issue, and it really isn't.

::::Second issue: it isn't clear that meta-analysis is popular in ''other'' areas of science.

::::There is no need for ATT on this: &quot;Parapsychology does not have a clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information.&quot;

::::But there might be need for better ATT on &quot;As a result, parapsychology remains an isolated science to such an extent that its very legitimacy is questionable.&quot;  It isn't really clear that it's Alcock's opinion.

::::Because the major critics do feel parapsychology is scientific, we should put &quot;Although critics may feel that parapsychological study is scientific, they are not satisfied with its experimental results.&quot;  This leaves the issue of numbers open.

::Okay, this will do for now. And it looks like you've already addressed Number 2, so let's look at Number 3 above, which is in two parts.  First, redundancy.  The material in the lead and the paragraph under &quot;Controversey over scientific status&quot; are all pretty general and address the same general concerns.  I think that we can eliminate &quot;Controversy over scientific status&quot; as a heading, and combine the material from both paragraphs into a one or two paragraph lead.  The edits that I linked above demonstrate one way of doing this.  I can wait to address the rest of Number 3 after you've had a chance to respond. --[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 21:07, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

::: I couldn't disagree more. The scope and content of the Controversy section are very clearly specific and necessary as a a separate section. A lead is for summarizing the following content of a section, not for glossing over the major point of criticism.

:::::*&quot;Proponents style parapsychology as a discipline compatible with science including schools of psychology, however those assertions and the results of parapsychological work have met with frequent opposition from critics.&quot; (first paragraph)

:::::Also, just noticed that I'd like to see something put back into WDM's draft.

I'd like the Nature quote (or a paraphrasing if we're not going with quotes) put back in. The line about the large portion of parapsychological work involving statistics was meant to lead into that quote about whether it is worthwhile, and how that's subjective. If you dump the Nature quote, might as well remove the &quot;A large portion...&quot; as well because it's out of place. I'd like to see the Nature blurb put back in though, because it sums up the various feelings about whether parapsychological work is worthwhile -- subjective.

::::The tone is what I object to.  That intro is extremely biased when it says: &quot;Proponents style parapsychology as a discipline compatible with [[science]]&quot; - I absolutely object to that, as the same thing can be said without bias as in my version.  But mainly, the edits the the lead were for making it more understandable.  I want the tone to be neutral and, -to be totally honest-, it isn't now.  We need to sound as if we are reporting straight facts. Basically, the changes in tone that I make are more neutral.  [3] and [9] are pretty important.  &quot;Parapsychology hasn't disappeared, however,&quot; uses a weasel word, and doesn't sound encyclopedic to me.  It makes it sound totally defensive, or if not defensive, then like &quot;it hasn't disapeared yet, but it's gonna.&quot;  But it doesn't sound neutral.  Also introduces the concept of &quot;disapearance,&quot; which is not otherwise talked about.

::::::Like I said, I'm cool either way. But just reporting straight facts is problematic because there's opinions all over parapsychology. That was proplem #1. You can't say factually that it is science, and you can't say factually that it isn't. Both statements rely on a subjective interpretation of the limits of science. For the most part the limits of science are clear (scientific method), but parapsychology is that weird kink where they apply scientific methodology to something that may be outside the scope of science.

::::::Your version was &quot;Inclusion of parapsychology as one of the sciences has met with frequent opposition from critics.&quot; and the problem with that is the uninformed reader may wonder &quot;Why should it be? It's just a belief system like astrology.&quot; I keep bringing this up in these talk pages, but always, always you must present the pro before you can present the con, otherwise the con has no context.

::::One of the definitions of &quot;style&quot; is to design, make, or arrange in accord with the prevailing mode.  That's pov, to say that Proponents design, make or arrange Parapsychology as a science. 
 
::::There's gotta be a better way.
 
::::Perhaps just a simple statement that there is controversy over whether or not Parapsychology is a science or a pseudoscience.  Then describe the controversy in later sections...

::::Nealparr, there are proponents of skepticism who style their view as the correct one.  And there are proponents of the paranormal who style their view as correct.  I do neither.  I want to report what people say, which in this case is to report the controversy.  But &quot;proponents style,&quot; is plain POV.

:::I think, definitely, parapsychology is academic parapsychology by every standard. In science discussions, it's always academic parapsychology that's referred to. In the history of parapsychology, it's always the academic history of parapsychology. I'm on board with that and it's definitely the more notable view. What I'm talking about is that there's a lot of paranormal researchers out there mistakingly calling themselves parapsychologists. It's become notable in recent years largely by the popularity of weekend ghost hunting. It's because of this that it did come up in the ArbCom.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some critics regard the methods of parapsychologists as a pseudoscience and to date there have been no experimental results that have gained wide acceptance in the scientific community as valid evidence of paranormal phenomena. The controversy over parapsychological study is said by some to be an example of the larger debate over the demarcation problem in science, which examines the boundaries commonly drawn between science and non-science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'll let others take a look at it, but my view is that the live intro is a lot more diplomatic. I hate the word pseudoscience because it's a pejorative. There are other ways of saying the same thing without using it. When looking for sources, the mainstream sources (not pro, but not completely skeptic) rarely used it.

::::::The summary of the criticism section is that critics feel that it is a failed, deprecated, or flawed endeavor because it lacks a framework that would make it sucessful, or a methodology that is convincing. This is a stark contrast from an outright pseudoscience that makes no effort whatsoever to be scientific but claims it is based on science, like astrology. That's all rhetoric, though.

::::::::Um, several other distinct topics with only a paragraph or two have their own headings. The point is that structurally, a lead is for summarizing the topics to follow (not detailing a topic mentioned in passing previously). The controversy over the basic scientific status is a distinct subject. It's not just a summarization of the other headed topics following, but a paragraph of unique and separate facts about the criticism of parapsychology as fundamentally unscientific. A debate over the basic status of the field is obviously a separate subject and isn't just a topic to be summarized as a peripheral lead into the following debates about the practices of that field. Lead: overview of the criticisms to come. Then headed individual subjects.

:::::::::I don't deny that the controversy over parapsychology's scientific status is important.  We could write volumes about it.  In fact, I seem to recall putting that heading there myself to begin with.  However, as it stands, the text under that heading is general and introductory, and IMO, kind of weak.  Unless it is beefed up considerably, it sounds more like lead material than anything specific enough to require it's own heading, at least for the purposes of this summary at present. --[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 07:17, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::::::::&lt;s&gt;That might work, but if I can't think of a proper intro to satisfy everyone, let's just revert to the current version without a &quot;Controversy...&quot; header. I'll make a sandbox of the section.&lt;/s&gt; Eh, after looking at a Controversy section with all the current lead material in it, it doesn't fit. The only stuff that fits is what was in the Controversy section originally. So if that section's original contents fits better in the intro than the intro in the section...let's just leave WDM's version how it is.  [[User:VanTucky|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#E49B0F&quot;&gt;VanTucky&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:VanTucky|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:44, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

Let's compare these two sentences.  In WDM's earlier version, one sentence came from the lead, the other sentence came under the heading &quot;Controversy over scientific status&quot;:

&quot;Critics of parapsychology question the field's status, arguing that the work is unscientific, partly because it lacks a framework within accepted scientific models, and partly because after decades of research it hasn't presented evidence that they say provides conclusive results.&quot;

and

&quot;Some of the more specific criticisms state that parapsychology does not have a clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information.&quot;

These ideas are related...yet in the draft, they are in different paragraphs and in different sections.

We have a similar problem here:

From the former lead:  &quot;Critics of parapsychology question the field's status&quot;

Then under the next heading: &quot;Alcock states that parapsychology remains an isolated science to such an extent that its very legitimacy is questionable.&quot;

And now let's look at the first paragraph: 

From the first sentence: &quot;...the entire field of parapsychology has produced no conclusive results whatsoever.&quot;

Then the last sentence: &quot;...after decades of research it hasn't presented evidence that they say provides conclusive results.&quot;

If you want this article to have GA status, you need to have a clear organization and you need to edit away reduntant material.

WDM, these edits will do for now.  Anything else I might want to change are mostly copy edits which we can address after your draft has been installed.  Now onto the rest of Number 3...at this point, I think that the rest of the text of criticism section can fall under these three headings:

Fraud

Criticism of experimental results

Criticism of meta-analytic techniques (I think this heading is more NPOV than what you have now)

(I would suggest doing the headings in the above order because the specifics under each heading tend to follow this chronology)

Now, the material in the section titled 'Selection Bias' can be broken up and placed under the headings I suggest above.  Selection bias is an important issue when it comes to meta-analytic techniques, so it could go under that heading.  The second paragraph under 'Selection Bias' is about statisitical deviation.  This is really about how experimental results are interpreted, so I think that this paragraph can go under the heading &quot;Criticism of experimental results&quot; instead. (I hope that wasnt't too much.)--[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 07:10, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

==Draft intro==

The WDM draft's intro is unnecessarily imbalanced and needs to be addressed before it gets copied over, especially considering this was just supposed to be a merger. Present company excluded, a number of editors have come through here and commented in various places that they saw nothing at all wrong with the live intro. There was consensus on that, and consensus on the draft's slight rewrite from a few days ago, but the new version doesn't have consensus. If you'd like to take your ideas and present a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; full intro, I'd be happy to take a look at it. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 20:36, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

I see that most of what is different is the second paragraph, which does go into some detail explaining the reasoning of critics. This is a little excessive, and I tried to simply state that controversy exists on the two basic points (whether it is science, and the results) without going into detailed explanations. I also inserted a fact that was in neither intros (I think); that most in the scientific community recognise the field as using patently scientific methods, even if they are flawed. It might be kind of obivous, but intros should state the obvious for beginners. The following is a rough mashup of an intro, and it could need some moving around for ideas flow. One piece of notable information, that I think is more important than some famous people were involved in teh field, is that it used to recieve research funding and facilites from universities. If someone can think of a good mention of that to add, I'd like to include it. Tell me what you think...
&lt;blockquote&gt;Parapsychology is the study of evidence for paranormal psychological phenomena such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinesis. The Parapsychological Association describes parapsychology as &quot;the scientific study of paranormal or ostensibly paranormal phenomena, that is, psi; except in Britain, the term has largely superseded the older expression 'psychical research;' used by some to refer to the experimental approach to the field&quot;.[1] A large portion of parapsychological work involves examining statistical data about psi. Historically, the field has attracted notable personalities in psychology including American psychologist and philosopher William James, among others. Parapsychological researchers promote the field as a discipline completely compatible with mainstream science, however, that assertion has met with opposition from critics. The controversy over parapsychological study is said by some to be an example of the larger debate over the demarcation problem in science, which examines the boundaries commonly drawn between science and non-science. While most in the scientific community recognise parapsychology as using scientific methods, some of the results of this research has been discarded by critics due to what they purport are methodological flaws. To date, no evidence for paranormal psychological phenomenon has been widely accepted by the scientific community.

::::For convenience, here's the most important parts from the above:
::::&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of view that parapsychology is not scientific is a contentious point of view and there's plenty of sources that show there are differing mainstream opinions on the matter. We're slanting the intro towards just one in its current incarnation. This is odd because none of the other mainstream encyclopedias do that. While Wikipedia is certainly different, it shouldn't diverge too much from the other encyclopedias in tone, especially since the stated goal of Wikipedia is neutrality. One other thing that's odd is that our intro is less neutral than the entry on parapsychology in the Skeptic's Dictionary [http://www.skepdic.com/parapsy.html]. It doesn't even say pseudoscience. We really need to reword the intro, and if my wording isn't good enough someone needs to offer up some examples that are better, neutral, and with the goal of stability in mind. One thing to consider in doing so is what are we trying to accomplish, an intro or a summary of the article. If it's the former, we don't need to summarize everything (see [[psychoanalysis]], also accused of being a pseudoscience). If it's the latter, why does it mostly just sum up the criticism? Where's the summary of the history, or the summary of the research, or the summary of the current laboratories, and so on? If it's just notable ideas, the most notable is the controversy over using scientific methods to research something that may be outside the scope of science. That's multisourced and can even be sourced to the Skeptic Dictionary. We have a lot of options available to us. Like I said, it's a choice to use the current wording and that's not a choice I would support and one I believe is actually against the spirit of Wikipedia's guidelines.&lt;/blockquote&gt;--'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 04:24, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

And you're not getting what I'm saying : ) We choose which facts we want to put in the intro. We choose which approach we want to take. Choosing more negative facts, even when they're true, slants the intro. We could, for example, take a historical perspective and make it all neutral.

&quot;Parapsychology studies blah, blah, blah. It has it's roots in psychical research from the 19th century which investigated spiritualist's claims. In the 1930s, it switched to experimental methodology. In the 1970s, in a climate of alternative theories, research increased. In the present climate those enthusiams have waned and the results remain open to interpretation.&quot;

Boom, done (though that would need to be dressed up). Totally neutral and factual intro. The intro in the draft chooses to go negative, even if they are negative facts.

== Just wondering why this article is so biased ==

I am receiving emails asking me why on earth is Wikipedia trying to vilify parapsychology?

It seems to me, and to others I see, that some Wiki editors are determined to define a subject here as they think it aught to be defined, rather than simply explain what it is. An article about Parapsychology should explain what it is. It is not necessary to spend a lot of time--if any--on what it is not.

The whole paragraph beginning with ''&quot;Many scientists feel that parapsychological study is at best on the outer edges of science because it involves research that doesn't fit within standard theoretical models accepted by mainstream science.&quot;'' is clearly designed to tell the reader that, ''&quot;if you believe in the supremacy of science, then you must accept that parapsychology is all bunk.&quot;'' That paragraph need not be there at all if you are simply trying to explain what parapsychology is. Further, as I think Nealparr is saying, you can explain what it is without validating it or discrediting it. That is unnecessary characterization.

I personally do not see anything wrong with having a criticism section, but as it is written, it seriously biases the article. The Research section tells the reader what parapsychology studies in a pretty straight-up fashion but the criticism section makes accusations that the accused deserve to be able to respond to. There is just accusation. That bit about fraud is pure nonsense in a modern context, as extraordinary results are seldom included in data summaries--in effect, they are averaged out. As is, the subsection is just typical skeptical innuendo.

By the way, why is there an advertisement for James Randi's book on the page? '''Isn't that a little obvious?'''

By the way again, in the Research section, OBE research is not usually considered '''Survival Research''' in parapsychology. It is considered a proof of survival by some people, but then, so is EVP, reincarnation and mediumship, which I do not see listed there. To be fair to the majority of parapsychologists, the field of parapsychology should not be linked to survival research, as it is more effectively studied as a reported human experience that needs to be understood. I would either add all of those other survival-related subjects or take that heading out. Finally, the heading looks like it applies to '''Anomalous Psychology''', which I think was not intended.

:::&quot;Before launching off your little tirade, ...&quot; Nice response.

:::People just see the article, they do not know to go and read weeks and weeks of changes and discussion. I had a kid who was doing a report email us and ask why people still think parapsychology is real if all of those things are wrong with it. A member wanted to know if I planned on getting back to the EVP article and whatever happened to parapsychology. There are others, but the general point is that the article is what is visible and it clearly is biased. I hope you all have it balanced out before the kids start their next round of term papers.  [[User:Tom Butler|Tom Butler]] 21:04, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi, Tom.  First off, do be aware that the current parapsychology article is based off of a draft that I had been working on in my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Annalisa_Ventola/Sandbox sandbox], and was installed here by NealParr with some revisions.  It was installed here in an incomplete form, but the consensus was that even in its incomplete form, it was a vast improvement over what was there before.  It has its problems, but it has been relatively stable over the past few weeks.

I think its important for the lead to frame the debate about the status of parapsychology in the wider scientific arena.  Like it or not, the current scientific paradigm is materialism, and parapsychology is at odds with that paradigm.  The results of parapsychology are not widely accepted by scientists, if they were, we'd see more integration with parapsychology in the mainstream.  There is nothing about this paragraph that is not fair, and I think it's important to readers to understand the big picture before continuing with the article.

There has also been a general consensus with editors from both sides that the best way to stabilize the article is to allow parapsychology to state its case, let the critics state their case, and that's it.  Article over.  What we are trying to avoid is this constant cycle of criticism and response that made the last version of the parapsychology so problemmatic.  Personally, I find it difficult not to respond to the criticisms, but I really think it's best this way.  In a way, the &quot;Laboratories, organizations, and publications section&quot; is the response.  Despite what the critics say, parapsychology is still an active field that maintains its ties with the academy...that is parapsychology's best response, IMO. 

I don't see the advertisement for Randi's book.  You'll have to point that out to me.

We didn't get to finish the section on survival research before intalling the draft here.  If you look at my sandbox, you'll see that we had plans to address other phenomena.  Parapsychology is still very much interested in phenomena 'suggestive of survival' so we could change the heading to that.  The phenomena of OBE's is suggestive of survival (at least in the sense that follows a similar research paradigm to NDE's), so I do really think that it belongs under that heading.

If you look at the table of contents, Anomalous psychology is not under the Survival research heading.

And yes, there is another attempt at a rewrite going on, but it's not all that different from what is already here, so I see no problem with discussing your issues, Tom. --[[User:Annalisa_Ventola|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Annalisa Ventola&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;([[User talk:Annalisa Ventola|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Annalisa_Ventola|Contribs]])&lt;/sub&gt; 21:49, 8 July 2007 (UTC)


::Annalisa, thanks for the response. I see that Nealparr has changed the Randi image. Looks much better.

::I understand that the parapsychology article is contentious. And obviously, I have not visited it for some time, but I try to respond to comments and questions from web site visitors at aaevp.com and this subject has come up more frequently than usual. My response is usually to say that first, I am not a parapsychologist and cannot speak for the field. But then I add that parapsychology is .... But I will not labor the point here.

::I tried pretty hard to find the credentials of Odling-Smee and all I could find was a Dr. studying Influence of ecology on learning in threespined sticklebacks.&quot; (http://cognition.icapb.ed.ac.uk/index.php?page=s/3/z-alumni/index.html) I hope that is not the same one who wrote the Nature article because she is quoted all over the parapsychology article. That should get her a good promotion at work to study more fish.

::If the revision in the works now is just a little different from the current version, then it is probably going to remain unstable. Letting ''&quot;...allow parapsychology to state its case...&quot;'' is not going to work because those who can will have conflicts of interest by Wiki rules and few are as aggressive as skeptical editors.

::Okay, I appreciate your response and good effort. I understand that it is very difficult to work so hard for consensus and have someone drop in to complain. I can't tell website visitors to ''&quot;just wait.&quot;'' Maybe I can find a different source that does not measure a soft science in terms of hard science.   [[User:Tom Butler|Tom Butler]] 22:53, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Odling-Smee is the independent author of the independent article in Nature this February about the closing of the PEAR lab. It's not an editorial piece so the credentials of the author isn't the issue, but rather the credentials of the periodical itself that hired her to do the news story. It's Nature being quoted, not the author's opinions. Secondary source versus primary source. It's actually a great source for this article. The reason that news article was chosen is because it's the most recent article to appear about the topic in a mainstream science periodical and talks about the very things brought up in this article, how mainstream science views parapsychology. We spent a lot of time looking for a source on mainstream science's view that didn't come from a solely skeptical publication or a pro-paranormal publication. This source is as good as it gets. A lot of the article is sourced to varying opinions about the topic, where Nature is an independent source that has nothing to gain or lose and has no real point of view they're supporting. --'''[[User:Nealparr|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;Nealparr&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nealparr|talk to me]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:03, 9 July 2007 (UTC)
