==License tagging for Image:GSS.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:GSS.jpg]].  Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated.  Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image.  This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
*[[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
*[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]].  If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 15:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

==[[:Janmejay tanwar]]==
A tag has been placed on [[:Janmejay tanwar]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Janmejay tanwar|the article's talk page]] explaining your position.   Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  [[User:Kon-Tiki001|Kon-Tiki001]] 23:04, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

==[[:Image:GSS.jpg]]==

Hi.  When you uploaded [[:Image:GSS.jpg]], you did not specify complete source and copyright information.  Another user subsequently tagged it with {{tl|GFDL-presumed}} and for some time, it has existed on Wikipedia under the assumption that you created the image, and that, just as with all of your text contributions, you agreed to license it under the [[GFDL]].  This assumption, however well-meaning, is not legally sufficient and the tag is being phased out.  Images using it are being deleted.

This image has been tagged for deletion and will be deleted in one week if adequate copyright information is not provided.

'''If you, personally, are the author of this content''', meaning that you took the photograph yourself or you created the chart yourself (and it does not use any clipart that you did not create), please retag the image with a free [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image copyright tag]] that correctly describes your licensing intentions, usually {{tl|GFDL-self}} or {{tl|PD-self}}.  Please also make sure if you have not already done so that you write a good description of what the image depicts, when you took the photo, and other important details.  This will allow Wikipedia to continue using the image.

'''If you did not create the image''' or if it is derived from the copyrighted works of others, please keep in mind that most images on the internet are copyrighted and are not suitable for use on Wikipedia.  Wikipedia respects the copyrights of others and does not use images unless we know that they have been freely licensed.  Any creative work is automatically copyrighted, ''even if it lacks a copyright notice''.  Unless the copyright holder has specifically disclaimed their rights to the image and released it under the GFDL or another compatible license, we cannot use it.  If you did not create the image, simply do nothing and it will be deleted in a week.

Please feel free to contact me on my talk page if I can be of assistance or leave a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]] with any questions you may have.  Thank you. [[User:MER-C|MER-C]] 12:40, 26 May 2007 (UTC)

==License tagging for File:SarunMaataImage01.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:File:SarunMaataImage01.jpg]].  You don't seem to have indicated the license status of the image.  Wikipedia uses a set of [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]] to indicate this information; to add a tag to the image, select the appropriate tag from [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/All|this list]], click on [[:File:SarunMaataImage01.jpg|this link]], then click &quot;Edit this page&quot; and add the tag to the image's description.  If there doesn't seem to be a suitable tag, the image is probably not appropriate for use on Wikipedia.

==  Proposed deletion of Janwar (Rajputs) ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Janwar (Rajputs)]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''Subject does not pass the notability criteria to become a stand alone article.It belongs to [[Chauhan]] subclan of the broader [[Rajput]] community and such articles are pre-existing. At the most, the article [[Chauhan]] may contain a line that 'Janwar' are also a branch of Chauhan, if the sources support. Presently the article does not have any source to support its contents.. .'''

While all constructive contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[{{TALKPAGENAME:Janwar (Rajputs)}}|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Mahensingha|MahenSingha]] [[User talk:Mahensingha|(Talk)]]  17:13, 7 September 2015 (UTC)
