A {{[[Template:prod|prod]]}} template has been added to the article [[A Mi Manera]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice explains why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dated prod}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:A Mi Manera|its talk page]]. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached. If you endorse deletion of the article, and you are the only person who has made substantial edits to the page, please add {{tl|db-author}} to the top of the page. &lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; [[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] 04:35, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

*Wikipedia isn't a schoolboy's game, it's an encyclopedia.  If you can't be serious about it, you should go somewhere else.

**I'm Latino too, and I don't watch Univision, Galavision, or any other mind destroying Spanish TV crap.  But that's neither here nor there.

==Notability of [[:Ser Un Rebel]]==
A tag has been placed on [[:Ser Un Rebel]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done for the following reason:

&lt;center&gt;'''''Unnecessary song/album page of a deleted/non-notable artist'''''&lt;/center&gt;

Under the [[WP:CSD#General_criteria|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not meet ''very'' basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Your first article|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article]], and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Ser Un Rebel|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn-reason --&gt;  '''[[User:W guice|&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot; color=&quot;#bb0000&quot;&gt;tomasz.&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 11:54, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

==Speedy deletion of [[:Suite Life On Deck]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|32px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Suite Life On Deck]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A1|section A1 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Suite Life On Deck|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. [[User:Hersfold|'''''&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:blue&quot;&gt;Hers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:gold&quot;&gt;fold&lt;/em&gt;''''']] &lt;sup&gt;([[User:Hersfold/t|t]]/[[User:Hersfold/a|a]]/[[Special:Contributions/Hersfold|c]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:57, 21 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;!-- Template:Db-nocontext-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt;

:I'm sure you didn't, but to avoid unnecessary clutter on the project, we have to filter out articles about subjects that are [[WP:N|non-notable]] or whose articles don't contain enough information to provide more than a basic understanding of the subject. Once the series gets off the ground, you might be able to write an article on it, but since [[WP:CRYSTAL|Wikipedia is not a crystal ball]], we'd much rather wait until we have solid information than speculation of something that may or may not occur. You may also want to look at the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] for more information. Thanks for contacting me about this, and happy editing!
